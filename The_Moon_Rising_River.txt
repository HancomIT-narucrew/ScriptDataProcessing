THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.
She only knows her name. Yeom Ga Jin.
Can you please let her stay here?
The day Mother died.
I must know what happened that day.
Whose memorial service is it?
Dal is his son. General On Hyeop.
"General On Hyeop"?
The Sunno Tribe also
suffered for no reason.
They were framed for treason.
I have no time for a country bumpkin.
I am here to find someone.
The Jangbaek herb store!
You left that place
along with the princess!
She is the daughter of the
king. Princess Pyeonggang.
Listen to me carefully.
Your life is not yours alone.
The people of the Sunno Tribe
sacrificed their lives to save you.
If you want to kill yourself,
you need to get their permission.
Are you going to stay in this village?
The princess is dead.
EPISODE 5
"Pyeonggang".
It is a strong and blessed name.
That is your name,
Pyeonggang. Do you like it?
There seemed to be
circumstances she could not explain.
I could not bring her with me.
But I can tell you this on my life.
It is definitely the Princess.
Does she resent me?
No. She did not say anything as such.
She will have grudges.
She will hate her heartless father.
Right now, bringing her
back safely is our priority.
If the rebels hear of this...
The rebels...
would include Gochuga, right?
My father does not yet know.
How far...
can I trust you?
You must trust me...
to see the Princess again.
I will find a way to
bring her back safely.
When we are ready,
you just have to give the command.

I am a filial and thoughtful son,
I do not wish to cause my father concern.
By that, you mean...
I was never in to see the King,
and you...
never saw me.
I do not know what is going on,
but how will you suffer the
wrath if Gochuga were to find out?
Head Eunuch.
That depends on your sly tongue.
Speak less...
and extend your lifespan.
The King went to Magnolia Hall?
I heard he came by suddenly
and took a look around.
But that is not the only strange thing.
He was usually drunk on
alcohol or high on drugs.
Today, he touched neither...
and stayed in his chambers.
When one acts out of the ordinary,
they say their time here has ended.
You might get your way much easier.
Great things do not happen by luck.
The King is obsessed
with the Princess' ghost.
We must turn that fear into reality.
The Princess?
The young girl who went missing
when the Queen was killed?
Yes. After that, she lost her memory...
and lived in Cheonjubang.
How could this be?
We should throw her out
immediately for the safety of the village.
She said she wished to leave out of guilt.
I am not sure, Chief.
What would my father have done?
The general...
would have followed the flow.
The flow?
Sometimes one must stay
even if we want them gone,
and one must go even
if we ask them to stay.
Do not try to work against nature.
But what happened that
day tore our tribe to pieces.
My father died framed and shamed.
That was not the Princess' fault.
I know that, but...
I cannot even look at her face now.
It is just too hard.
Are you home?
Where is she? Did she really leave?
My goodness.
I thought you had just left.
What is this?
On Dal's mother made it
for me. Do I look strange?
No, no. It suits you perfectly.
Dressed like that,
you look like one of us.
Will you stay with us
and not go anywhere now?
If only I can.
If you want to, it is done.
What are you worried about?
I must throw something away.
Oh? There she comes.
The young lady brightened
up the whole village.
That pretty thing was a killer?
That is so dreadful.
She said she quit. Do not bring it up.
Can a meat-eater...
survive on vegetables and herbs alone?
I am sure Dal has a lot on his mind.
Will you really not eat?
Where is he?
You stayed up all night,
will not eat all day, or move a finger!
Will you shrivel and die where you lie?
You fool!
You fool!
You got your way!
You brought the girl back,
the King's army did not
get what they came for.
What else is there?
The villagers said they accept
her knowing she was a killer!
What are you so upset about?
You broke your word with
me to leave the mountain,
and you even went to Pyeongyang Castle?
I would love to break your legs,
but I am holding back.
I am sorry, Mother.
If you know that, come in and eat.
I should be punished for doing wrong.
Just like we promised.
Dal.
Dal.
He is truly captivated.
My gosh.
The well was almost
dry, and so is the stream.
We might all wither away
if the drought continues.
Let us go higher up.
Oh? Dal!
What?
Why is he suddenly keeping a distance?
Did you and Dal fight?
No.
As if I have the right to fight him.
I wronged him in many ways.
Dal may speak like an uncultured swine,
but he is really sweet.
He will get over it soon.
Do not worry at all.
You just saw him.
He is taking his hoe to get punished.
To get punished?
Did you promise your mother...
you would work if you ever...
left the mountain again?
You are doing this because of me.
I should be the one to get punished.
I came to say something upsetting.
I will stay in Ghost Valley.
I know I am guilty and being shameless,
but I want to live.
I do not want to go to the palace
where Father acts like I am a ghost.
I will no longer...
do anything that gets blood on my hands.
I will work in the fields, fell
trees, and gather herbs...
and live a good life, like you.
If you do not like it and say no,
I will leave.
The stars are not aligned.
What?
The drought will go on for a while.
That is why I am digging a
well. It is not because of you.
Then are you okay with
me staying at Ghost Valley?
The villagers accepted you.
You. What do you think?
My thoughts?
My thoughts?
I should start thinking
how I feel about it.
Are there any leftover iron pieces?
Could you add this and melt it all?
Yes. She brought them here herself.
She told me to make sickles
or whatever the villagers need.
If a killer throws away their blade,
it must mean serious business.
How could it be you?
Your father...
killed my father...
and annihilated my tribe.
Dal. Do not ask.
You can go...
and find a way to live on your own.
You returned from the
mountain empty-handed.
Why are you here now?
If I am empty-handed,
I can carry whatever I find.
The King is up to something.
If you do not do something
about the Princess,
I will get involved myself.
You must be busy with politics.
Leave it to me, Father.
What brings you here late at night?
I heard you are trading illegal herbs.
I came to investigate.
This cannot be found in Goguryeo.
Did you buy it from Baekje or Silla?
You defend our Capital,
and you care about
what a herb store sells?
If you are smuggling items,
which is against the law,
you deserve to be punished.
Even the Five Tribe
council overlooks our trade.
Listen.
I am Head of Capital Defense.
Not a puppet of the Five Tribe council.
Burn everything.
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Come inside.
To save over 180kg of herbs,
what must a woman do?
The information you gave me last time...
was useless.
I did not catch a wild
animal, let alone an assassin.
Did you not?
My father pressures me every single day,
and I do not know where the assassin is.
So...
I need you to help me in secret.
What help could the
owner of a herb store be?
General Go.
Through the Head Eunuch,
you are smuggling drugs into the palace.
To cloud the King's mind.
You are gradually increasing the dose.
That is not true.
I knew it.
You are lying,
and your pulse is still level.
Your jokes are too extreme. It is a joke?
I need your cunningness and courage.
Your ability to make one...
believe a lie.
I carved it myself.
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.
How are you?
What brings you here before breakfast?
I wish to return something to On Dal.
Put it over there.
He left at the crack of dawn...
without eating anything.
Did he go to dig the well?
How would I know where he went
when I do not know what he thinks?
What is it that you brought?
It is not much.
I just do not think I should have it.
I will return it to him myself.
Wait, stay where you
are. Can you take this too?
He asks for food the moment he wakes,
and he hasn't eaten in a while.
Does he not eat now?
Since...
you have decided to
stay here in Ghost Valley,
let me say just one thing.
I am listening.
Please do not cause...
any strife or bloodshed in this valley.
I am sure you went through a lot,
but there is none as pitiful as Dal.
If you ever think something
bad might happen,
then please leave then in silence.
Do you get what I am saying?
I know why you say this,
but I will not leave.
I owe Dal very much.
I must make it up to the villagers too.
I decided to turn a new leaf,
and I will show Dal...
how determined I am.
The world...
does not always give you what you want.
My goodness.
I wonder why you are ignoring Ga Jin.
I thought long and hard
and still could not get it,
but then I suddenly got it.
It is jealousy.
The soldier who came to catch her.
My gosh.
The handsome man with the lovely voice.
I thought he was here to catch her,
but I got this tickling feeling.
So what? So...
those two have some
sort of a relationship.
What relationship?
Some sort of a relationship.
You noticed that and got upset.
Out of jealousy.
Silly. If it were that, I
would actually feel better.
Then what is the problem?
There are lots of instances in the world.
Stupid instances between
people that people cannot change.
You get into a mess when
you are caught in a noose.
Is Ga Jin a noose, then?
You are here.
It is such slow going with a hoe.
Get out. Give me the pick.
I will dig out a rock for you.
I said get out.
I should make myself
useful if I am to stay here.
Leave the well to me and eat something.
Your mother is worried you
have been skipping meals.
Do not waste food.
I get that you hate me,
but the food is harmless.
I was young then too.
I did not know what was going on.
It was utter confusion and I was scared.
So...
why should I be treated like a criminal?
I am angry too. It is
unfair and I am angry.
Still...
I hoped that at least you
would understand me.
Then I could forget my past.
I could live happily
in Ghost Valley and...
Did I say it is your fault?
It is hard on me too.
I worry about you and
want to look out for you,
but I cannot.
Whenever I see you, I
am reminded of my father.
I saw him die.
I feel guilty...
towards my father and the villagers.
"She is the King's daughter."
"But I still like her."
That would make me a shameless fool.
We did not do anything wrong.
Yet we are being punished.
Thank you for telling me.
I will return this.
I hope you find water soon.
I will work in the fields, fell
trees, and gather herbs...
and live a good life, like you.
Why should I be treated like a criminal?
We did not do anything wrong.
Yet we are being punished.
Ga Jin!
Do not go.
Stay here as Yeom Ga Jin.
Work in the fields and gather herbs...
and live simply like that.
Do whatever you want.
You are not a princess or a killer.
You are just Yeom Ga Jin.
Okay?
Will you do that?
Do you...
forgive me?
Why forgive you when
you did nothing wrong?
Thank you.
I gave a chief of a meager
tribe an important task,
and you have done a terrible job.
I gave you time and you still
have not sent the assassin's head.
You are bringing upon your own demise.
The moment I run out of patience,
your dwelling will be
burned down and your life...
will be ended, so remember that.
Before we kill the King,
we must get rid of Go Won Pyo.
Who are you?
Jangbaek herb store's
owner is here to see Gochuga.
Report it.
What? They brought the assassin's body?
Yes. The herb store
owner came here in person.
That cannot be.
Gochuga wishes to see you.
The pickers found it washed up downstream.
It has swollen grossly,
but the features...
looked similar to the face on the posters.
This is unrecognizable.
You asked to see me?
You fought her closely,
so you must recognize her.
See if this is the assassin.
I will.
It is her.
Are you sure? Yes.
This is the assassin I
saw at the ceremony.
Come inside.
You have sharp eyes.
I see why your father
always boasts about you.
That is too grand of a compliment.
I must decline the offer.
That is not necessary.
We promised a reward in
return for the assassin's head,
so you are only getting what you deserve.
I did not do it to get paid.
You are always kind and
caring toward our family,
so I wanted to do something in return.
How praiseworthy of you.
I have always wanted
to meet you in person...
after having heard great things about you.
Thanks to her, we were
able to avoid trouble.
Feel free to visit me
whenever you need my help.
I am honored.
The herb store owner has
made a big contribution.
I trust people's greed.
Pardon?
An act of kindness to
repay one's gratitude.
I do not trust those who say things...
that are not visible to the eye.
Does that mean something is bothering you?
You found a dead body
faster than expected.
There are tons of dead bodies...
piled up outside the city walls
due to illnesses and starvation.
I had to pick a girl who
was of a similar age...
and had to bloat it underwater,
which is what caused the delay.
You purposely threw a dead
body underwater to bloat it?
You really are relentless.
Are you not the one who asked
me to do something so relentless?
I am talking about the man
who made me do the dirty work...
because he did not want
anyone to be suspicious of him.
I will repay you for what I owe.
You should brace yourself.
I will add a lot of interest.
We did great. Nice job.
He yelled and called me a ghost.
But then again, he thought I was dead.
I would have been startled as well.
But even so, you are his daughter.
I would be happy rather than scared.
So did you just run away?
I may be alive, but I am good as dead.
What about your little brother?
Even if we meet again,
he will not be able to recognize me.
My life in the palace feels like a dream.
My real father and friends...
are at Cheonjubang.
But that is also useless.
Let us go.
Where? Just follow me.
What are you doing?
Can you not tell?
I am measuring.
To do what?
My gosh. We need to make one more room.
This place is too small for two people.
You are unbelievable.
Why would you move here
when you have your own place?
And who says I will let you live here?
Do not come near me.
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?
I told you not to come near me.
I think you are mistaken...
Wood? Why do you need
wood to dig up a well?
Find me one that is long and
sturdy, not one that is bent.
And as for you, make her a straw mattress.
I know you cannot afford
to make her a silk mattress,
but a straw mattress is not good enough.
What? Trust me when it comes to women.
I know you are doing this for Ga Jin.
Yes, that is right. You
all told her she could stay.
So we should keep our
word and help her settle.
This is a big step.
Did you get your mother's approval?
Why do I need her approval...
to bring Ga Jin's father?
What? What?
I thought you were moving in with her.
I thought you were going to marry her.
"Marry"?
Who? Me? Yes.
With Ga Jin?
That is what you want,
right? You cheeky punk.
My gosh, I am already
angry that I got a nosebleed.
I will not take this!
So that is not it? Were we wrong?
You are not going to marry her?
You are not marrying her?
What kind of nonsense is that?
You become so violent
every time you get angry.
You really need to fix that.
You should have been more clear.
You were the one who
made it sound strange.
I cannot believe you are angry at
me when you are the one who hit me.
I am the one with the nosebleed, you know.
Are you laughing?
Sorry. I will not laugh.
Hey... What now?
About bringing my father...
Do you not want him
here? No, it is not that.
I am grateful for the gesture.
But I feel bad toward
you and the villagers.
You do not need to feel that way.
Let us go get him once
we finish digging up the well.
Until then, we can fix the house.
Dal.
You are doing everything for me.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Just tell me anything you want.
I will do anything I can.
It is something very difficult.
Will you be okay with it?
What is it?
Live a normal life, Ga Jin.
That is what you wished for.
How lame.
I already promised you that.
A promise holds no power.
Sticking to your word
is the difficult part.
Are you sure you will
never kill anyone again?
I threw away all my weapons.
Even if your life is at risk?
I will no longer do anything
to cover my hands with blood.
Then what about this? Gosh.
I already apologized.
Ga Jin.
You deserve to be happy now.
Do not worry about anything else.
Just do what is best for you.
He is waiting.
Hurry up and check.
Yes.
It is not her.
Are you sure?
It is not her.
She is of a similar age.
But she is a completely different person.
She is not the Princess?
I am sure...
it is not her.
Take her out.
I am sure she is mistaken.
She is the assassin... No.
She is the Princess.
She swore to stay loyal to
me to protect the Crown Prince.
There is no reason for her to lie.
Then...
are you saying I am lying to you?
You are my son, and you seem certain.
So I will have to believe you. Father.
Learn how to keep away from trouble.
Otherwise, you will shed blood.
The well is all dried up.
I may not be able to
see, but it hears like it.
I have water at my
house. I will give you some.
No, it is okay. I will
ask Dal to bring water.
He went to check the traps he set.
He never tells me where he goes.
What is this vegetable?
I bet they will taste nice with seasoning.
I may be blind, but I can hear
well and have a healthy body.
So do not pity me so much.
No, I do not pity you.
Then what?
Are you trying to repay
Dal for his kindness?
There is no need.
You are not the only person he is kind to.
Gosh, look at you.
You should be with your mother.
What are you doing here all alone?
Go on.
He was born with a kind heart.
Whether it is humans or animals,
he is not able to ignore...
those who have nowhere to go.
He has a heart like no other.
But how is that possible?
What do you mean?
I heard his family and villagers...
ended up dying a miserable death.
I am sure he felt resentful.
How could he not feel
the urge to take revenge?
Has he forgotten...
about what happened that day?
Life would be easier if we could
forget what we wanted to forget.
He is merely trying his
best to put it past him.
Every time he thinks of that day,
he becomes heartbroken and furious.
But he suppresses that
and puts it behind him...
because he wants to
be a decent human being.
"A decent human being".
Are you here to keep an eye on me?
I know I promised to share
rabbit meat, but I take it back.
I am not lying. Look.
I could not catch any.
I can see that. I am disappointed.
Gosh, just eat vegetables.
That is healthier for you.
I grew up eating dried
radish greens and dried radish.
And look at how energetic I am.
You and your excuses. I am serious.
We will never get to eat
meat if we continue to trust you.
From now on, leave the hunting to me.
We should also get rid of the
stones from the green farm.
The ladies seem to be having a hard time.
And when we dry herbs,
we should all do it together.
That will save time.
What? is there a problem?
No, it is not that.
Were you always this talkative?
You are even beating people now?
Let us take time with fixing the house.
The well is more urgent,
so we should dig it up.
I will help with that too.
Gosh, you talk like you are one of us now.
Or are you a fox
pretending to be Ga Jin...
so that you can eat my liver?
Goodness.
Ga Jin really hid herself well.
I cannot even guess where she might be.
I wonder where I can find her.
Therefore, you must take her
place and do her job instead.
Chief.
If we keep delaying it,
Go Won Pyo will kill us all.
Leave it to me. I will take care of it.
What makes you think
I am going to ask you?
This is a very important task.
You must hurry.
We will. We will.
We should go.
Once we arrive at Pyeongyang Castle,
we do not know how things will unfold.
We will not be able to
take care of you any longer.
Do you have a dangerous mission?
That is not it.
Gosh. It is better to check all corners.
You have nothing to worry
about. Go and stay with Ga Jin.
I also consider you
guys as my own children.
Whatever it is, please
take care of yourselves.
There is a village named
Ghost Valley at Mount Daeseong.
"Ghost Valley"?
I have a gate, so people
do not jump over the walls.
Why do you need to talk to
me without letting people know?
Depending on your answer,
I might have to take your life.
I heard that Gochuga is
suspecting the corpse to be fake.
It was very difficult to earn his trust.
But I may be seen as a
schemer and get blamed.
You already knew the identity
of the assassin, did you not?
You would not return after
making the trip to Mount Daeseong...
without finding out anything.
As long as the assassin
is not the Princess,
the identity of the
corpse does not matter.
I cannot trust you.
You served those awful drugs to the King.
But you helped his daughter get away.
Whose side are you on?
I fear Gochuga.
I understand that there are Five Tribes.
But we, the Sono Tribe,
cannot go against him...
because if we do, it will not
end with a few drops of blood.
Is that why you are trying
to get on every tribe's side,
so you can come up with a way to survive?
You are correct.
He has already slain innocent
people of our tribe in the past.
And the Queen died from
a false accusation as well.
Shut your mouth!
My father was ordered by the King...
and only subdued the plot of treason.
Even the King fears Gochuga.
Now, he is trying to murder a princess.
You will be forced to make
a decision soon enough.
Will you follow in your father's
footsteps onto a blood-stained path?
Or will you embark on your own path?
Are you fighting with the
rock? You are so foolish.
I am okay. I can do it.
Do not move.
If you damage your nails,
it will inconvenience you.
Hey, I said I was fine.
I think you got the wrong spot.
We have been digging for a while,
and we only see rocks, not water.
Do you not know the saying,
"Sincerity is the way to paradise"?
There is a saying that goes,
"Pour water into a cracked pot."
Let us see which one of us is right.
Hey, you will hurt your
hands. That is enough. Stop it.
Hey!
Stop it.
Hey! What is it? Are you okay?
Where did you get hurt? Let me see.
Hey.
Come on.
Well, I did not hurt my hand.
But it feels better.
You teased me about it.
But you were the one
fighting with the rock.
Look.
I won.
That is amazing.
This is nice.
Everything I am seeing and hearing here...
makes me think I am dreaming.
Dream?
Yes. If I were dreaming,
I would never want to wake up.
"I want to keep dreaming
to the end of time."
Then, sleep all you want.
I will not wake you up.
I will really go to sleep here.
Knock yourself out.
Do you remember a long time
ago, you and I sat on a rock like this?
You bragged about your
carved wooden horse.
Do you remember what
you insisted that day?
That you would become the ruler
and reign over the entire empire.
And you said you would become a general.
Do you still...
want to become the ruler?
I was young back then.
Now, everything seems so far-off.
Right. That is what you need to do.
Get rid of bad memories little by little.
And fill your life with something good.
What about you?
Did you get rid of all the bad memories?
Far from it.
Not yet.
This is so nice!
What is the point of wielding
your sword into the thin air?
You should have taken the
assassin's life when you had the chance.
No matter how hard I push myself,
I do not have the guts to
kill a princess of an empire.
But I know that you had done
the deed yourself a long time ago.
Let me teach you something.
A sword attracts blood.
If that scares you, I advise
you to hold onto a sickle.
Where the sword points
at is also important.
Did you really point the
sword at the Queen...
when it should have slain our enemies?
My decision was solely
for our family's sake.
It was back then and still is.
But you...
lied to your own father,
blinded by your affection.
Yes.
I am...
your foolish son.
Starting tomorrow, you will resign
as the Head of Capital Defense.
Who is there?
Are you all right? Catch them!
Assassins!
Go now. Hurry!
You are the hunting dogs from Cheonjubang.
Mother, I am on my way
to carry out my punishment.
If you have to carry out
your punishment again,
you might end up with a bride.
Gosh. Do not ruin my great
morning with such an absurd claim.
Here.
Why is it so heavy?
If you share your meal
with her, it will not be filling.
When my dear husband is returning
There was He is ridiculous.
Ga Jin. What?
Once we get the well going,
you should go home first.
We can fix the house in due time,
but you should bring your father first.
What if we never get the well going?
My father might die from waiting.
Do not jinx it.
Move.
Hey!
You...
What?
Hey!
Hey. Gosh.
This is... It is...
Hey!
Water!
We have water! Water!
Water! Yes!
Hey, what did I tell you?
I said we would find
water here. Take a look.
Okay. Stop bragging.
Water! We have water!
Well, I will go and bring the people.
Wait here.
Okay.
Did you find water?
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES
The people in our village
are happy to have you.
Perhaps, the Princess ended up here...
to tell us to forget about our
past and live our lives in peace.
Do not be rash and think of revenge.
Locate the Princess first.
We must be more cautious
of the Princess than the King.
If her nature resembles her late mother's,
her claws will hurt us pretty soon.
How dare you lay your hand on me?
I am the eldest daughter of the King...
and carry on the
bloodline of the late Queen.
I am Princess Pyeonggang.

Darn you.

Well, I will go and bring the people.
Wait here.
Okay.
Did you find water?
It is true! There is water!
There is water? That is amazing!
When did Dal ever tell a lie?
Never. Right.
I did not believe it. How did
you manage on your own?
I had Ga Jin's help.
Let us not waste time.
We should widen the hole.
We finally have more water.
Why are there so many rocks?
Why are you coming from that way?
Should I pee in the open, then?
Hey, Ga Jin! You did so well!
We should get more buckets. Sure.
You met Ga Jin?
You can take a horse
or cattle to a stream,
but you cannot make them drink.
I need Ga Jin to thirst,
so I sprinkled some salt.
Chief. Kill me instead...
and please, let Ga Jin go.
Who will die?
I am trying to save everyone's life.
To save the twins,
Ga Jin will have to kill again.
Stop.
Your chief sent you, did he not?
I know nothing about any chief.
That is right. We are just small thieves.
Where did you hide the
assassin during the ceremony?
Assassin? What assassin?
You keep asking things we
do not know the answers to.
Stop! I will kill you!
I will kill you! Please.
Stop!
We will see how long you last.
I have more than enough clubs and sticks.
You must go to sleep.
I will when I feel like it.
If you are not at ease,
that will cause our nation concern.
Queen.
Do you remember the Princess?
The Princess?
Who do you speak of?
Pyeonggang.
My most favorite daughter.
The child I lost.
Why would you suddenly...
speak of the Princess?
I miss her...
even more today.
Since you hallucinated in the library,
you are not in your right mind.
You must sleep deeply tonight.
I will bring some medicine. Leave it.
More than medicine,
I hoped for a warm word from you.
Forget about it.
The Princess is alive.
I will find a way to
bring her back safely.
When we are ready,
you just have to give the command.
We have more water
now. The water is so clear.
Dal, have a drink.
This is so precious. We have water again.
Do not waste a drop. This is so valuable.
It has been so long since we had water.
Here you go. Drink all you want.
There is so much now. Yes.
You worked hard. Refresh yourself. Thanks.
They brought more. This is so nice.
It is good to have water.
On Hyeop's son took you in.
Karma works in strange ways.
How long have you known?
Did you send me to the ceremony...
knowing who I was?
If the daughter killed her father,
Goguryeo would have fallen
into turmoil and never recovered.
It is a pity it did not happen.
How could you... It is easy to kill me,
but then Yeom Deuk will die too.
Even now, he shaves salt...
as he waits for you.
You rested for long enough.
Return to Cheonjubang now.
I said I will never kill again.
Then do you want to
return to the foolish King...
to play being a princess?
I have given up both
killing and being a princess.
I will live quietly on this mountain.
This is where cowards who do not have...
the courage to die live in hiding.
And Ga Jin you wish to live like that?
Do not fight your fate.
Even before I took you in,
you were destined to bring down Goguryeo.
Please leave.
I will get into trouble
if the villagers see us.
You are afraid.
You are afraid to face...
the King's crimes and the corrupt world.
I will not miss this time.
You found water,
but not yet a way to survive.
Go Won Pyo captured Tara San and Tara Jin.
They were looking for you
and then took your place.
The decision is yours to make.
Will you remain here and play house...
or return to Cheonjubang?
"The rules of a king are like a rock."
"They are weighty and never change."
"Also, the rules of a
king are like a blue sky."
"The depth cannot be fathomed."
Is the writing hard to read
or are you afraid of me?
No.
I am just...
Just what?
I am not used to...
seeing you sober.
Crown Prince.
Yes, Father.
Do you remember your sister?
My sister?
I do not remember much of her.
Only that she gave me a
candy before she left to patrol.
A candy?
I see.
These are so beautiful.
To see that you are this
pleased, Your Highness,
I am even more grateful.
Not at all.
I received an unexpected but great gift.
What should I do?
I like this and I like that too.
Pick what you want.
Can I really?
Your name is Mo Yong?
Yes.
The gifts you brought
show you have great taste,
but I am pleased that you care for my son.
I am honored.
I heard your daughter is good with money.
You must rely on her a lot.
She also has great knowledge
of herbs and medicine.
Keep her close and she
will be of great use to you.
We spent way too much money.
She would have been pleased with
something that cost half that much.
Small branches create
more smoke than flames.
To light a fire, you must use firewood.
Will that fire melt Gochuga's heart too?
He does not easily give his trust.
Even he who conquers the world...
is powerless against
talk shared in the bed.
Then are the rumors that...
the two are having an affair true?
I thought the King was the
only one oblivious to the fact.
Are you ignorant as well, Father?
My goodness.
What are they all flocking
over to plot this time?
We must gain Gochuga's
trust as soon as possible.
Only then can we join in the plotting.
The Princess is alive?
Is that really true?
Yes.
I am positive.
Gochuga.
What do you think?
If the Princess we held
the ceremony for is alive,
then we should be
thankful for the miracle.
Who brought you the great news?
That is not important.
The fact that the Princess is alive...
could perhaps...
become a problem down the line.
We must decide on preventative measures,
and that is why I summoned you.
The nation would rejoice at the news.
Why would it be a problem?
Yes. That is utterly unreasonable.
When the Princess disappeared,
many people died or got hurt.
If word of that were to spread again,
it could cause trouble.
I will prevent groundless talk.
You need not worry.
Then...
find the Princess first.
General Go.
Yes, Your Majesty?
I trust in you.
Thank you.
You have the King's trust.
He called you to discuss
an important matter.
I am still a bit flustered.
I just cannot believe it.
The Princess is alive?
The King has shown his
intention. That is good enough.
Pardon?
He is afraid the Princess will return.
A daughter who remembers
her father's ugly actions.
She is no longer an offspring.
She is a bringer of death.
I heard that Dal...
told only you who I am, Chief.
I would like to ask you about something.
Come inside. That day...
Did you remain in the village
with General On Hyeop?
Yes, I did. Then did you...
see the last of...
my mother?
After Dal and I left for Yibullansa,
what happened?
That is what I wish to know.
It is all in the past.
What would you do with that knowledge?
Was Gyeru Tribe's Go Won Pyo...
there that day?
He was, right?
Go Won Pyo.
Withdraw your troops right now.
Do you think you will be able to
get away with killing the queen?
His Majesty was the person who told me...
to kill you.
Your Majesty.
I will not forgive you even after I die.
You will never be able
to take over Goguryeo.
Goguryeo is...
already mine.
Your Majesty!
The Queen...
remained with the
Sunno Tribe until the end.
She did not give in to the treachery.
Thank you.
Something had been plaguing me.
You just cleared my head.
Princess.
Do not think of getting revenge.
You might be here now
because the late Queen...
wishes you forget the
past and live quietly.
Dal said something similar.
Do not worry.
Now that we have a new well,
to welcome Ga Jin to the village,
we should kill a few chickens.
How far do you think
a few chickens will go?
A pig. We should slaughter a pig.
That is worth a feast.
If you eat too much meat during a drought,
you could get sick.
That is so disgusting.
Buy her a sewing kit.
Would she like something like that?
I had a look around her house.
She does not have a mirror.
A mirror? A woman...
needs a mirror in the house.
Ga Jin does not care for that.
How can you know so little about women?
No woman dislikes putting on makeup...
or wearing accessories...
Right. Where is the necklace?
I did not see her wearing it.
I think she threw it away.
Why would she throw away
something that valuable?
She had her knives and daggers melted too.
She wanted to get rid of her old things.
She must have a lot on her mind too.
The decision is yours to make.
Will you remain here and play house...
or return to Cheonjubang?
Do not think of getting revenge.
You might be here now
because the late Queen...
wishes you forget the
past and live quietly.
It is dark. Are you looking at the moon?
Why are you here?
Tell me if you need anything.
What?
I am going into the city to
sell animal hides and herbs.
Do you need any tools or household items?
No. Are you sure?
Do not complain later on.
Have a safe trip.
Okay.
You have been acting
strange since yesterday.
How so? You will not speak to me.
You are always on your own.
Why is that?
Do not blame the
innocent. I never did that.
Then what is it?
Did I do something to upset you?
You must be bored. Go home.
Go.
I remember this feeling.
Ga Jin.
The villagers...
are pleased you are here.
Not to mention me.
So do not get any ideas.
I wish you enjoy your life here.
An unidentified killer
attacked Go Won Pyo...
but failed.
Things in Goguryeo...
Mo Yong. Why are you still here?
Did you not say you
would trade with someone?
I was just about to leave.
Right now, while you are about to leave,
some others will have
already made bargains.
Riches are fleeting.
They only stay with those who move fast.
Would I forget something you
said until my ears would bleed?
The negotiations are done. I
just have to check the items.
Even if you find even one
flaw, haggle the price down.
No. I will haggle even
if there are no flaws.
Yes.
I do not need anything.
Do herb shop owners...
frequent bars as well?
I heard this place makes
good money and might buy it.
If it will make you money,
you will do anything.
I am truly impressed.
I did not know you were
bored enough to drink alone.
It is the opposite.
I have so much to do,
my head might explode.
Shall I share my meager wisdom?
Why?
Do you want to know why I met the King?
Once I tell you,
you will weigh things out
to decide whom to side with.
No, thank you.
Are you concerned for the Princess?
Gochuga wants to kill her...
and you wish to protect her.
You are torn.
It is none of your business.
I do not wish to care, but it bothers me.
Because you are suffering.
I hope the Princess decides to return.
She is the King's daughter.
Pyeongyang Castle is where she belongs.
I will make it so.
You are determined.
Is that out of love...
or out of loyalty?
It is both.
You said I must make a choice.
Whether I will follow my father...
and take a path drenched in blood or not.
You are clever, so make a guess.
Do you...
smell blood on me?
General.
I was demoted from
Head of Capital Defense.
I was upset, so I had a drink.
Oh, right.
I have not yet told the King.
That I am no longer
Head of Capital Defense.
Thanks to you,
I am alive.
I will behead the assassins
in public tomorrow.
I will give you 300
mounted men with armor...
and 300 soldiers.
Pardon?
That is a bigger force
than the place guards.
Can you handle them?
Whom do you want me to attack?
I am sorry.
Just this once, forgive me.
I will return once my friends are safe.
Salute!
Salute! Salute! Salute! Salute!
Salute! Salute! Salute! Salute!
Salute! Salute! Salute! Salute!
I heard the Gyeru Tribe have
gathered a bunch of soldiers.
Yes, I heard it too.
I heard the troops are
led by General Go Geon.
Do you know what is going on?
No.
How would I know what
the Gyeru Tribe is up to?
Gochuga has always
been a very suspicious man.
Father.
Something serious is happening
in and outside the palace.
How can you be so calm?
When the world is going through chaos,
the best thing to do is to sit
back and watch what happens.
What if you get involved
only to get yourself in a mess?
You are so frustrating.
Until Geon Mu becomes the crown prince...
No.
Until he finally takes the throne,
you and I must always be on our toes.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Of course.
I filled the pot with water,
so use as much as you
want. You can wash too.
What kind of a fool
washes during a drought?
But must you leave?
I will be back as soon
as I sell the herbs...
and buy the things I need.
I had an unpleasant dream.
What did you dream of?
You know that new girl, Yeom something...
Mother, she has a name.
Yeom Ga Jin. Anyway,
she was wearing
something really expensive...
that looked like the wings of a dragonfly.
She was sitting somewhere very high up.
And you were sobbing in front of her.
You seemed heartbroken.
What a silly dream.
I will be off now.
Please be careful.
My goodness, what a nasty dream.
Why not take me with you
so I can help you carry all that?
What good will she do?
I am sure you do not have
the eyes to pick out a mirror.
You are going to buy a mirror?
I need one too.
Goodness, I will not take long.
I heard people in the city are
also suffering due to the drought.
It is okay if you fail to sell everything.
Just come back quickly. He is right.
But where is Ga Jin? I
have not seen her anywhere.
I am sure she is fine.
Come on. We are spending
way too long saying goodbye.
We will be back. Goodbye.
Bye. See you.
Bye. Bye.
Do not take too long.
Wol seems so excited.
I will go save Jin and San.
This is the last thing I can
do to repay you for raising me.
And?
Then I will leave with my father.
Do not ever look for me again.
Your fate will come looking
for you even if I do not.
I will not be there.
Do you think you will be
able to escape forever?
If a moment comes where
I can no longer avoid it,
I will have to fight.
Yes.
You will soon end up facing
a fight you cannot avoid.
Father.
Are you okay?
Ga Jin, what are you doing here?
I told you not to come near this place.
Do not worry.
Once I bring back San and Jin,
we can leave together.
I found a place for the both of us.
Will you be okay on your own?
There will be a lot of soldiers.
Take him to the hut.
Do not do anything to harm him.
Ga Jin.
Do not worry.
This will really be my last time.
I have a message for
my people of Goguryeo.
Due to the cruelty of the
skies, the lands have turned dry.
And migrant thieves have started
to bring more chaos to the country.
Think of all the castles
they have burned down...
and the countless people they have killed.
They dared to be hostile to our country...
and threaten the safety of your King,
which makes them the root of all evil.
Therefore, I will execute those thieves...
in front of thousands of people...
to teach everyone the power
and dignity of Goguryeo.
There are so many people gathered here.
Let us sell our stuff here.
We can see the criminals too.
Sure.
Do you think it is a show?
That kind of stuff is
not something to watch.
Let us get going.
Are they assassins?
Are you sure you will
never kill anyone again?
I will no longer do anything
to cover my hands with blood.
What are you doing here?
You should be in Ghost Valley.
Why are you here instead?
And what are you wearing?
The criminals that got caught...
are my friends.
They got caught...
while doing my job instead of me.
Do not tell me...
They are like my family.
I cannot let them die.
So what? Are you saying
you are going to fight...
with all those soldiers?
I just need to save my friends.
I will not hurt anyone.
Dal, this will be my last time.
Please let me do this.
Dal!
Ga Jin.
What brings you here?
Pung Gae.
We need to help Ga Jin.
What? Dal.
You cannot do this alone.
This is not something
you should get involved in.
No, this is our problem.
You are a member of Ghost Valley.
The criminals are outside.
He is going to behead them...
to hide who was behind
the incident of the ceremony.
And thus, he wishes to suppress
the people by instilling fear.
Gochuga is a very greedy man.
He is trying to catch many
birds with just one stone.
Is General Go in charge of the scene?
The guards are there,
but the person in charge
was not General Go.
We found the entrance.
Did you check the
surroundings? There was no one.
There is not a single rat here.
Where are they hiding?
Search the entire place.
Search the place!
Yes, master. Yes, master.
You dogs of Goguryeo have
traveled a long way for nothing.
Cheonjubangs are everywhere,
but at the same time, we do not exist.
You will never be able to find us.
I wish you dogs a peaceful death...
inside your grave.
Do not touch anything!
Run! Get out of here!
Let us go back to the palace.
As soon as we save your friends,
we will be returning to
Ghost Valley right away.
Be careful.
What is that?
My goodness, look. Look at that.
Goodness! It is a fire!
Oh, dear! What happened?
There is fire! What are we going to do?
My goodness! Oh, my gosh!
Pung Gae, is this really okay?
The fire is too big.
It will be fine. The stable
was all rotten anyway.
People will come and
put it out. Let us go.
Okay.
Look. Goodness.
My goodness.
Now.
My goodness. What is going on?
Ga Jin.
Ga Jin.
Ga Jin.
We need to go!
Hurry! Hurry up!
Get going!
Hurry up and leave! Go!
Dal!
Go! Hurry.
Hurry up and go!
Just go!
What are you going to do now?
They will not be able to
leave the city looking like that.
Will Dal be okay?
How am I supposed to know? Darn it.
Why are you taking it out on me?
Where are you going? Hey.
Who are you?
Do you remember me?
You must pay what you
owe. You cannot just leave.
I promise to pay what I owe.
Oh, it is you.
Please help me with a few injured people.
I want you guys to hide at the herb store.
What about you? I need to go find Dal.
Are you also a Cheonjubang?
What is that?
Where are the criminals?
"Criminals"?
You guys are the ones who do bad things.
Tell me right now, or I will behead you.
Father...
Stop!
How dare a petty killer come back here?
How dare you...
lay your hands on me?
I am the eldest daughter
of Goguryeo's King...
and the late Queen Yeon,
Princess Pyeonggang.
How dare you claim the
title of the royal household?
You must want to be beheaded.
Go Sang Cheol.
I remember you.
I also remember how you
mercilessly massacred...
the people of the Sunno Tribe.
Shut your mouth!
What are you waiting for?
Behead these two right now!
If you dare touch the body of a princess,
your entire family and
relatives will be annihilated.
She is lying!
The Princess has long been dead!
Kill them!
Step back!
She is Princess Pyeonggang!
Make your curtsy to Her Highness.
I am Head of Special Forces Go
Geon, paying respects to Your Highness.
Dal.
Where is my friend?
Tell me where my friend went! Come here!
Hey! Hey!
Can you not hear me?
Where is my friend?
Tell me where she is!
Hey!
Oh, my.
My goodness.
My gosh. Princess Pyeonggang?
I, Princess Pyeonggang,
have made it back to the palace.
Please forgive your
undutiful daughter, Father.
So it was not a dream.
You were not a ghost.
You were actually alive,
Princess Pyeonggang.
I lost my memory...
and have been living
without knowing who I was.
I apologize for making you worry.
Not at all.
It is all good since
you made it back alive.
Thank you for coming back to
your father who has failed you.
Princess?
What happened?
I guess your friends will
live longer than I thought.
Dal...
You do not have to worry.
Nothing will change just
because the Princess is back.
I am sure the King is not
that glad to have her back...
as he is guilty about what
he did to Queen Yeon.
Regardless of what happened in the past,
she is his daughter after all.
We cannot feel relieved
as we do not know...
how the King will change
because of the Princess.
You must pay close attention
to both of them, Daedaero.
Why are you not saying anything, Gochuga?
A princess who lost her
memory became a killer?
She survived and managed
to come back to the palace.
The one we have to keep in
check is the Princess, not the King.
Why should we keep an
eye on that mere chit of a girl?
She is a cub.
If she takes after her
late mother's nature,
soon, her claws...
will be directed at us.
Mother.
Your unfilial daughter, Pyeonggang,
has finally come back.
I can finally tell you...
the long patrol is now over.
Her funeral was grand.
People of all ages and
gender mourned for her.
She adored the people of Goguryeo.
Even at her last moment,
she protected the
people of the Sunno Tribe.
You must be tired. You
should get some rest.
Tell me all those stories later.
They put my friend...
in jail.
He was trying to help me.
I think you should let him go.
The Five Tribe council is in
charge of prisoner dispositions.
If you give an order as a king,
the Five Tribe council
should follow it too.
Did you say he is your friend?
Yes.
He is also my savior...
who saved my life several times.
Commander Go said...
he could have gotten
rid of the Princess...
if you did not get in the way.
Is that true?
How could he kill the Princess
at the heart of the Capital?
How will you deal with the consequences?
I only stopped him for
the sake of my family.
Was it not because
you admire the Princess?
Laying aside your family
because of your feelings...
is not appropriate for the
next head of the Gyeru Tribe.
You should be more careful.
It is not something I
should be careful of.
What did you say?
The woman...
whom I have buried in my heart
for a long time has returned alive.
Earning her heart is as important as...
ruling the world.
Hey! Bring back my friend!
Can you not pretend to listen at least?
Hey!
Quiet down. How dare you act up?
Do you wish to die in here?
My goodness. Good sir.
I have something to tell
my friend, so please call her.
Please? Hey!
Look at this guy. How dare you?
Move.
Let me teach you a lesson.
Sit still, you jerk! Oh, gosh!
Is Tae Mo not back yet?
He will be here soon.
Chief, everyone is anxious.
Perhaps this plan is too dangerous.
Chief.
Ga Jin went into the palace.
I hear she is the Princess of
Goguryeo who died a long time ago,
and the whole Capital is in chaos now.
So she...
returned to the palace?
Does that mean...
you knew who Ga Jin was?
The people of Cheonjubang were
born in a field and raised in a mountain.
Only the ones with a strong
mind and soul to kill the King...
can follow my path.
If you are afraid, stay.
Those who are brave,
come with me.
The heads of the Five Tribes would
like to greet you, Your Highness.
I am Gochuga of the
Gyeru Tribe, Go Won Pyo.
I would like to congratulate
you on your return to the palace.
Congratulations, Your Highness.
Congratulations, Your Highness.
What is this?
A talisman that will make you queen.
You must see but not look,
and hear but not listen for
your family to be at peace.
Goguryeo is...
already mine.
It has been long.
I am delighted to see that you
are in good health, Your Highness.
I have been well,
thanks to you.
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES
You should come with me.
I cannot.
I am back as a princess,
so I should live at the palace.
I hear you could have
gotten rid of the Princess.
I am all alone in Pyeongyang Castle.
Father and the Prince
find me uncomfortable.
I will be on your side.
You? The next head of the Gyeru Tribe?
If you disobey my
order, I will disown you.
Something dangerous?
What is it that you want me to do?
Everything related to the Princess.THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.
Go Won Pyo captured Tara San and Tara Jin.
The criminals that got
caught are my friends.
As soon as we save your friends,
we will be returning to
Ghost Valley right away.
PREVIOUSLY
I am the eldest daughter
of Goguryeo's King,
Princess Pyeonggang.
The one we have to keep in
check is the Princess, not the King.
If she takes after her
late mother's nature,
soon, her claws will be directed at us.
It has been long.
I am delighted to see that you
are in good health, Your Highness.
I have been well, thanks to you.

EPISODE 7
Let us go.
Hurry.
The King is pleased you are back,
but he is also very surprised.
Did you see the Crown Prince?
I should greet the Queen first,
before visiting the Crown Prince.
He looks more like his father each day.
PRINCE GEON MU
He is so strong too.
That is good.
When the Crown Prince becomes king,
he can do his duty as a younger brother.
I am sorry.
He has a bad cold and is asleep.
Come to Magnolia Hall
as soon as your cold heals.
There is a lot I wish to tell you.
You do not have a sister.
Princess Pyeonggang
is not your true sister.
The late Queen Yeon had an affair,
and she was the dirty result.
She wants my son to clean
up after the Crown Prince?
I could not believe what she said.
That is rightly what a sister would say.
What did I say?
We should have demoted the Crown Prince...
and replaced him with my Geon Mu.
Now it looks like the
Princess will get in our way too.
There is a time for everything,
and the power must be balanced.
That power could go to the Princess.
She looked carefully at my son's face.
As if...
she suspects that...
he is not the King's offspring.
Oh? Is that not Dal?
My goodness. Chief. Chief.
What happened?
We heard no news, so
we expected the worst.
There was a huge fuss.
You will faint if you hear what happened.
What happened?
Who are they?
Something happened in the Capital.
It is a long story. I will explain inside.
Yes. I shall come with you.
I will make some kudzu tea.
No. This is between father and son.
Did he have to upset me?
Princess?
I see.
She is the Princess.
Why do you not seem surprised, Mother?
Not much will surprise
you when you are my age.
It is for the best. How so?
Now, because of that girl...
Because of the Princess, you
will not have to fret anymore.
And Ghost Valley will be safe.
Think it was a crazy dream...
and forget about it.
What are you suspicious of?
I was told the Sunno
Tribe was plotting treason,
so I sent soldiers over
to quell the rebellion.
I had to save you and your mother.
However...
Mother died a gruesome death,
and I lost my memory
and was left to wander.
Do you think that happened...
all because of me?
Yes. I am a good-for-nothing
father, and I am ashamed.
Is that good enough?
I just want to know...
if you send soldiers
for a different reason.
Was it truly just a rebellion
that you suspected?
That is enough.
You return after eight years...
only to blame your
father, and on top of that,
you even suspect nonsense.
I am too ashamed to face you myself.
At the ceremony,
I almost committed a crime for
which I could never be forgiven.
We need not discuss the past.
Did you not do that...
because you had lost your memory?
But...
it will remain with me for a long time.
My terrible actions at the ceremony,
and your command to send soldiers...
to attack the Sunno Tribe.
The air is cold in the evenings.
Come indoors.
The moon is very bright.
Porridge will be easier
to swallow than rice.
Crush this up and put it on your wounds.
Well...
I am very grateful.
You even got us a house
to keep us from the dew.
This is a palace compared to a damp cave.
Did you live without a place to call home?
Well, something like that.
Do not speak too much.
We at least fought Goguryeo.
Instead of hiding like you.
What did you say?
I knew you would call on me one day.
I brought in the fake corpse.
Because my son told you to?
Is that what your excuse will be?
No.
General Go said the corpse
was that of the assassin.
But I also knew that...
the assassin was Princess Pyeonggang.
Your herb store seems
to reach every corner.
Your trickery...
is how the Princess got away.
I did it to save my family and my father.
I think highly of your honesty.
But do not think you
will get off easily...
when you deceived me.
You will have no use
for my worthless life.
What is it that you want me to do?
Why are you here at this hour?
Well...
Did he question you for helping me?
No.
He said he has been feeling weak
and asked if I have any good herbs.
Quit with the nonsense.
It is the truth, General.
Even if you are
threatened for what you did,
do not get involved in
something dangerous.
Something dangerous?
Everything related to the Princess.
While brewing medicine for Gochuga,
shall I brew some for you as well?
Oh, dear. My gosh...
What do you want?
Blame Ga Jin for this.
She is the reason Cheonjubang scattered.
Our chief fled too.
Take him.
Hey.
What are you doing, you jerks?
Let him go. Let go of him!
Mister. Get out of the way.
Let us go.
Nice.
Say hello. This is Ga Jin's father.
I was told the Sunno
Tribe was plotting treason,
so I sent soldiers over
to quell the rebellion.
I had to save you and your mother.
The Sunno Tribe also
suffered for no reason.
They were framed for treason.
The Queen...
remained with the
Sunno Tribe until the end.
Master Go.
Go Geon greets you, Your Highness.
When too much is on your
mind, you must be active.
I needed an opponent.
I am glad you are here.
Next time, you must
find a different opponent.
I am all alone in Pyeongyang Castle.
Father and the Prince
find me uncomfortable.
I am pleased.
Now you are back.
I owe you a lot.
I will not forget it.
Right.
Have you heard of the Jangbaek herb store?
Every herb that enters the palace...
goes through that woman.
And my father is not the kind of person...
to call her over just to discuss herbs.
I heard you supply...
the Crown Prince's herbs.
Since you are good with medicinal herbs,
you must know well of poisons too.
Add this to the Crown Prince's
morning medicine tomorrow.
Okay.
Dal.
Did you come for me?
Were there not some extra
herbs they sent to put in?
You foolish girl. Such a scatterbrain.
Add this to the Crown Prince's
morning medicine tomorrow.
The Crown Prince...
Stop!
Who are you?
Stop!
Won.
Your medicine will get cold.
Your Highness.
What is the use of
drinking this day and night?
It only makes my mouth stuffy,
but my body still remains weak.
You will soon become healthier.
Here. Drink up.
How is my sister doing?
You should go to
Magnolia Hall to visit her.
She will be glad to see you.
No, I do not have anything
to say to her anyway.
Drink up.
Won! No!
Do not drink that.
You did not drink a single drop, right?
Princess Pyeonggang, what is the matter?
The medicine is poisoned.
Why were we summoned
to the palace all of a sudden?
I feel so perplexed.
Do you think it is because of
what we sent to Northern Zhou?
Do not say that out loud.
Do you know what this is about?
The Crown Prince was in danger.
The Crown Prince?
What is this?
There was poison
mixed into the medicine...
that the Crown Prince regularly drinks.
What?
"Poison"?
Are you sure?
I tasted it myself.
It was fatal enough to
keep me paralyzed all night.
And this morning, the Crown
Prince almost drank this.
An attempt to poison the Crown Prince...
is a severe act of treason.
But if you are framing someone...
by making a wild assumption,
that will also not be taken lightly.
I am not making an
assumption. I can tell you...
that the person behind
this is in this room.
Watch what you say, Princess.
They are all loyal servants of Goguryeo.
Sometimes, you find rice
hulls among grains of rice.
If the perpetrator confesses,
we will be able to find out
who was behind this incident.
Bring her in.
Your Majesty, she is my daughter.
Hae Mo Yong, you are the
owner of the Jangbaek herb store.
Do you bring in the medicine
for the Crown Prince?
Yes.
Yesterday, you sent a
different bag of medicine...
on top of what you normally use.
What was it made of?
Mo Yong.
You put poison inside the
Crown Prince's medicine.
I tasted that medicine myself.
Who gave you orders to do that?
I am sure that person is in this room.
Tell us the truth.
I never added any kind of
poison, so there is nothing to tell.
If you are innocent,
drink this medicine.
If you are still alive
even after you drink it,
I will believe you.
Mo Yong.
Stop.
I see you are trying to kill yourself...
because you are scared
to tell who was behind this.
Mo Yong!
This medicine was not made to kill anyone.
Your Majesty.
Did you find out the
components of the medicine?
Yes.
Based on the investigation
carried out by the physicians,
Goldcrest Wilma was added
to the original ingredients.
Goldcrest Wilma cleans your blood.
That cannot be true.
I am sure it was poisoned.
You will have no use
for my worthless life.
What is it that you want me to do?
I heard you supply...
the Crown Prince's herbs.
Since you are good with medicinal herbs,
you must know well of poisons too.
How do you plan to get away
with poisoning the Crown Prince?
He is not our target.
Geon will be back soon,
and I want you to pretend like
you ran into him by coincidence.
Why are you here at this hour?
He said he has been feeling weak
and asked if I have any good herbs.
Have you heard of the Jangbaek herb store?
Then he will tell the Princess...
that I met you.
Move.
No one is allowed inside.
What kind of trick did you play this time?
You upset me.
All I did was make medicine
for the Crown Prince.
I did not play any tricks. I
know that you and my father...
plotted to put the Princess...
in trouble.
I see.
I finally see what caused the
Princess to get the wrong idea.
If you were going to give her a heads up,
you should have been more clear.
The Princes is in trouble.
She brought chaos to the palace.
How could you doubt your loyal servants...
just because of some nonsense?
A princess...
should always be careful
of her speech and behavior.
You were too careless this time around.
My daughter may still
be young and insufficient,
but her loyalty to the royal
family and her country...
is as great as mine.
I cannot express how sad
and upset I am, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.
Calm down, everyone.
The Princess...
surely has been through
a lot outside the palace.
It is not a surprise that she is not
used to the customs of the palace...
and the proper behaviors
of a royal family member.
If you admit that her behavior
was not very adequate,
we are willing to put this behind us.
Princess.
Apologize to them.
You must admit to your faults.
I did nothing wrong.
What?
I only did what I could
to save the Crown Prince.
I do not think...
I need to apologize for that.
Silence.
Starting from today, you will not
be allowed to exit Magnolia Hall.
Father. You will be punished there...
until you are told otherwise.
This is outrageous. She has no respect.
My goodness. Goodness gracious.
This is all my fault. I
should not have said...
what I was not sure of.
Either that,
or you schemed this with your father...
to fool me.
Princess. I do not care...
whether you fooled me...
or got used yourself.
What I know for sure is
that no one in this palace...
cares for my father or the Crown Prince.
I will...
stand on your side.
You? The son of the Gyeru Tribe?
He is the most powerful
man in this country.
But at the same time, he
is the weakest and loneliest.
I will protect him.
I must protect him.
Nanny, this necklace...
A long time ago, the King sent this here.
So we can keep it safe
here at Magnolia Hall.
Gosh. It is like he knew that
you would be coming back.
Who was it?
Pardon?
The only person that could protect me...
is in the mountains, very
far away from the palace.
Then,
who was that from last night?
I am sure you mobilized an assassin.
It may be dangerous inside the palace.
But the Princess would
be alone outside the palace.
On top of that, she was
helpless being intoxicated.
It was the perfect chance for
you to secretly get rid of her.
And even if you fail,
you can argue that she
wrongfully caused trouble...
and diminish her reputation.
Am I wrong?
Your insight is...
too good to waste at Pyeongyang Castle.
I heard the Gokturk twins
were spotted at Gyeru Fortress.
Go and take care of them.
Are you...
kicking me out to a
remote area in the north?
If you accomplish greatness
there, it will help our family.
Leave in a few days.
I will not go.
Withdraw your unjust order.
If you go against my order,
I will disown you.
Do you wish to become a lowlife
instead of being the eldest son...
of Gyeru Tribe's Chief?
Is that what Gochuga told you to do?
I am talking about the herbal
medicine meant for the Crown Prince.
So you lent a hand in
tricking the Princess...
and putting her in danger, correct?
No.
I only provided medicine
for the Crown Prince.
Politics is...
no more than an economic
means for our prosperity.
I do not care if the palace is in chaos.
I will be happy as long as we
are left with gold in our hands.
Do not get involved more than that.
Of course.
Oh, right. A guest...
gave us a message that their
expected arrival is tomorrow.
It is an important and discreet guest.
Be careful, so the news does not leak.
I will prepare thoroughly.
Thank you for making this long trip.
Please.
This way.
Make sure there are no mistakes.
Of course.
My Crown Prince.
I can come another time if I am intruding.
You are my brother. How
could you be intruding?
My visit will be brief.
I remembered this from my childhood.
When I whined to have more of this,
you always let me have it.
You brought me sweets.
I came here to thank you.
You believed that my
medicine was poisoned.
You must have been flustered.
Even so, I am still grateful.
All right, then.
This is too much for just me.
Would you like to have some too?
May I?
"May I?"
Be casual with me like you used to.
It is making me uncomfortable.
But...
Can...
I?
Sweets will not taste
good when they get soft.
After Mother's funeral,
Father became someone else.
He was enraged.
And at one point, he started to weep.
He neglected the state of affairs.
And there were many days
when he did not leave his chamber.
This must have been
very difficult for you.
I...
I am okay.
I am sorry.
I should have returned to
the palace as soon as I could.
I am sorry.
Pyeonggang.
That woman must pay for what she did.
Who?
The woman from the Jangbaek herb store.
She is providing Father with awful drugs.
Everyone at the palace
will not openly discuss it.
But I hear things too.
People say that her drugs are
nibbling at Father's body and soul.
"Awful drugs"?
She secretly brings it in from Silla.
That is a serious
violation of the law, right?
Won.
Keep what you told me to yourself.
Why?
What if you also get
punished just like me?
That does not scare me.
Those Five Tribes are plotting
schemes behind our backs.
I find that disloyal.
You have grown up a lot while I was away.
Cheers to our business.
Now, everything has been resolved.
Mo Yong, do not just stand
there. Pour him a drink.
Yes, Father.
Here.
Gosh.
The drinks...
What a greedy man.
He must have been
happy to finalize a big deal.
Being a daughter of such a man...
must be tough.
You are welcome to stay overnight.
We must walk and set sail.
I do not have time to waste.
Before I get exposed,
I must go back to Silla.
I wrote down a list of
generals, the number of soldiers,
and the weapons they carry...
on the border.
I checked several times.
I am certain it will match.
My King has recognized
your contribution to our empire.
Kim Cha Seung: IN CHARGE
OF MILITARY FORCES IN SILLA
When you come back to your hometown,
you will be graciously rewarded.
I am only doing my
duty as a woman of Silla.
Hurry back before the morning breaks.
16 YEARS AGO, OUTSKIRTS OF BISABEOL, SILLA
I plan to use you for something important.
Are you prepared?
You saved me from certain death.
I will jump into a fire for you.
Go to Goguryeo.
Let me see...
What is important...
is that riches is the
only thing that is forever!
Yes, that is true. You are right.
Oh, dear. My lord. My lord.
My lord. Oh, dear.
Oh, no.
What happened? My lord.
We must have another drink. My lord.
What is it you want? Speak.
Do you want silver,
or do you want land?
I am an orphan with nowhere to go,
but I know herbs and acupuncture
and am quick with math.
I wish to work for you, my lord.
May I serve you like a father?
Stand.
Princess.
Do not go, Princess.
Nanny. The King told you to behave.
If you disobey him
again and get into trouble,
then his subjects will truly revolt.
His subjects? The men who
think nothing of the royals?
Princess.
Nothing you say will stop me.
This is for Father.
Are you surprised?
When you were here as an assassin,
I followed you,
and barely found this passageway.
Do not get in my way, Master Go.
I am here to help you.
I do not need your help.
I have a loud voice.
I can shout from here and
wake the sleepy guards...
at the North Gate at once.
I have no time to joke with you.
I did not wait here just to
exchange jokes with you.
In a few days,
I must head to a northern fortress.
I cannot disobey my father's command.
So I came here to keep my promise.
I will be on your side.
What can I do to help you?
I am aware that Hae Mo Yong...
is illegally smuggling
herbs into the country.
Here, she has hidden
hundreds of kilos of herbs.
You know she is
smuggling it in from Silla.
Her drugs are ruining the King.
Why did you let it happen?
Because I also made a deal with her.
What deal?
Come with me.
Not long ago, I saw she had herbs here.
She moved them already.
What is it?
Step back.
Do not be afraid.
Princess.
Change clothes with me.
What are you thinking?
I need to know why
these children are here.
What is the Princess up to?
She does not leave Magnolia Hall.
She just reads.
She only pretends to read.
If you notice anything suspicious,
alert me immediately.
Princess.
You must stay safe.
Come!
Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up.
Take them.
Get up.
Come on.
Let us go. Walk.
Move it.
Walk.
Who are they?
Where are they going?
I do not know.
We only know that we
are going to Northern Zhou.
What?
They are the tribute to Northern Zhou?
Yes.
The grain and tributary gifts
were sent off a few days ago.
But...
we were brought here before that.
There is nothing over
here. What about there?
Nothing but moss.
That is odd.
We always leave a wooden
pass beneath these rocks.
They abandoned you.
The other killers will have gathered.
All but you.
It is obvious.
What did you just say?
Step aside.
Quick, look underneath.
Hang on. You... Darn you.
Lift it a bit higher. Quick.
I found it.
Step back.
Where do you go?
"Song", "hwa", "dang". Songhwadang.
Where is Songhwadang?
I do not know if you do not.
I have never heard of that place.
I have geotjeori.
SONGHWADANG
I have men all over the city.
They will spread word
of a talented fortune-teller,
so people will flock in soon.
The darkest place in the
world is right beneath the lamp.
Now, instead of a 180cm
sword, I will use my tongue...
to penetrate the King's heart.
Have you come up with an
idea of how to enter the palace?
Has the Princess woken up?
She has not yet. It looks
like she has caught a cold.
What about the doctor?
Pardon?
You should have called
the doctor for the Princess.
Yes, you are right. I was
about to call the doctor.
She must be sick because
she is under heavy stress.
I need to check how she is doing.
But she is still in bed.
Step back.
You said she was sick with a
cold. Where is the Princess?
I asked where the Princess is.
Since last night...
I have not seen her.
What?
Hey, you! Get up!
We walked all night
without even a sip of water.
How dare you? Take a short break.
We are quite far from the Capital.
It will be okay to rest.
Yes, my lord.
Rest! Take a rest.
Thank you.
As if the offerings are not enough,
they are sending women too?
If we are not going to Northern Zhou,
what will happen to us?
Their clothes and
accent are that of Silla.
Silla?
We were sold off.
We should be going to Northern Zhou,
but they hid us to sell us to Silla.
The great people from high up.
Do not worry.
The King's soldiers will
come before we reach Silla.
I am from the government.
Are you?
What did our country ever do for us?
It is the same for us, whether
we go to Northern Zhou or Silla.
We will serve some rich
lady or marry some old man.
No.
All of you will get to go home. I promise.
There is a knife in my back pocket.
Get it for me.
Will the King's men really come?
Goguryeo...
would not let their people
be sold to another nation.
Protecting them is the empire's duty.
We should go now.
Get up now. Get up! Stand up!
Get up.
What? The Princess has disappeared?
It is such an embarrassment.
She always got up to
something since her return.
She even disobeyed my order to behave.
Where on earth did she go?
She will be somewhere in the palace.
Do not worry too much.
We searched for her already.
She is not in the palace.
How dare she?
Father.
Actually...
I went to Magnolia Hall yesterday.
Your Majesty. General
Go wishes to see you.
Tell him to come back later.
And?
General.
I was waiting to see
you since early morning.
I told you to come back later.
It involves the Princess' safety.
Keep going.
Hey. Stop there.
Whose is it?
Is it yours? No.
It is at your feet!
No. It is hers, not mine.
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES
The Princess hid herself among
the women sold off as tributes?
No matter how much power
or wealth one may have,
anyone who violates the
law will be held responsible.
It is the principle King Pyeongwon
follows as he rules the country.
Say hello.
It is the arrow that shot
your girl eight years ago.
You two make a good couple.
I will marry you.
Royal marriage?
I will never join the Gyeru Tribe.
Is the daughter trying to follow...
the path where her mother fell?
I will never give up on you.
She will eventually become mine.
If you cannot win, you should run away.
If I had planned to run, I would
never have returned to the palace.THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL

EPISODE 8
Your Majesty. General
Go wishes to see you.
Tell him to come back later.
General.
I was waiting to see
you since early morning.
I told you to come back later.
It involves the Princess' safety.
Keep going.
Hey.
I got nothing. No one knows...
what Songhwadang is.
That does not mean
you can drink my alcohol.
What man gets upset so easily?
Jin, he is more
narrow-minded than he looks.
Do you have something?
No. No one has heard of that name.
Where is On Dal?
He has one last place to ask.
Does he think he is Ga Jin's husband?
That is what he is like.
Once he decides he will protect something,
he will do it, even if the sky falls.
Ga Jin is just like that.
She is the same.
It must be tough being friends
with someone so frustrating.
Exactly.
Hey! Move.
Owner!
Today must be my day
for unwelcome visitors.
I am a valuable guest.
I am here to offer you a way out.
What are you doing here?
You do not need to know.
The women who should
have gone to Northern Zhou.
Where did you take them?
I am guessing you sold them to Silla.
Tell me which road they are taking.
Women?
Do you buy and sell people too?
There is nothing in the
world that cannot be traded.
That goes for people and their hearts.
You should not act out
behind Gochuga's back.
What if he scolds you again?
This has nothing to do with my father.
On the contrary,
the silver I got in
exchange for the women.
Who do you think took half of it?
The Princess...
hid herself among the
women sold off as tributes?
So General Go took the special forces...
and the King summoned Hae Ji Weol.
The Princess has overturned her fortune.
We should do as she wishes.
Do not try to talk yourself out with lies.
I am here on the King's command.
Tell me where the women are.
You should just cut me down.
I am giving you a chance to come clean.
But you refuse it.
Would I be the only guilty party?
I knew you would do this.
I sent some men out at dawn already.
They will check all the routes to Silla.
Even if you keep quiet, I
will eventually get what I want.
And the Princess will protect the women.
The Princess? She is with them now.
To save the Goguryeo people.
Ga Jin? Where did she go?
She is a princess.
General!
We searched the main
roads, piers, and rivers,
but we could not find the women.
You have one last chance. Speak the truth.
Cut out my tongue then slit my throat.
Hae Mo Yong!
Squirrel Pass.
Drug dealers and poachers
from Silla choose that path.
That is the only way out if
they want to go undetected.
General. Are you sure
you will not regret this?
Tie her up and take her in!
Yes.
General. General, you must not do this.
Lead the way.
Keep going.
Hey. Stop there.
Whose is it?
Is it yours? No.
It is at your feet!
No. It is hers, not mine.
Stop!
Drop the sword.
Do not do it. He cannot kill us.
Shut your mouth.
He paid a lot of silver for us.
He will not be able to kill me.
I said, drop the sword.
Just kill me too! I do not
want to live like this anymore!
Kill me too! Just kill me!
Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me! Keep quiet!
Just kill me!
I am sick of this!
Kill me! Kill me!
Move!
They are gone.
They have gone. We are safe now.
Are you all right?
Dal.
Ga Jin.
Mo Yong.
I cannot believe this.
The Princess...
must be determined to
destroy the Sono Tribe.
Calm down.
Did Lord Kim also get caught?
No, I think he managed to escape to Silla.
That is all that matters.
You should quickly meet Gochuga
and find a way to deal with this.
I have already met him.
Gochuga is a very complicated man.
He has failed to keep
his own son under control.
Princess, what is it
that you need to tell me?
It is embarrassing enough...
that he tried to sell the
women of Goguryeo.
But he even secretly sold them to Silla.
And it was done by the
head of the Sono Tribe.
I hope you are right this time.
I witnessed it myself. I
heard and saw everything.
These women are also my witnesses.
Is it true that you were meant
to be sent to Northern Zhou?
Look at me.
Is that true?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty.
It is not good to let people
outside the palace hear them cry.
Let us talk about this inside.
He is right.
We should also listen to
what Lord Hae has to say.
Do not worry.
I will resolve what happened.
Thank you. Thank you.
The Sono Tribe is in charge of...
trading many different items,
which is probably what
caused the unfortunate incident.
They are not items. They are people.
They are beautiful women of Goguryeo.
How could you give such an excuse...
after having made a
deal with a Silla merchant?
Lord Hae.
What you did was foolish and wrong.
I am extremely ashamed of myself.
That is not enough.
You sold those women for
your own personal interest.
You violated the law and
traded with our enemy, Silla.
They are all serious crimes
that cannot be overlooked.
We need to get one thing straight.
Lord Hae did not do it for
his own personal interest.
I was the one who asked him for a favor.
What do you mean, Gochuga?
Our country is in financial trouble.
So I asked him if he knew a
way for us to gather more silver.
I know very well that he did
it out of loyalty to Goguryeo.
But that means...
General Go, I want you to
go to the royal warehouse...
and check the silvers.
Yes.
General Go.
Let us go back.
Gochuga is a very complicated man.
He has failed to keep
his own son under control.
He told me to move the silver...
to the royal warehouse.
He also said he even already
moved the silver we gave him.
He is making a small
sacrifice to save everyone.
Even so, we will be losing so much money.
We need to stay alive...
for any of that to even matter.
Right now, we need to
make sure we stay alive.
He chose the wrong method
to fill the treasury fund,
but you must not doubt Lord Hae's loyalty.
And if this information leaks...
and the people of Northern
Zhou find out what happened,
things will surely get out of hand.
He is right.
They will get furious at
us for deceiving them.
Lord Hae made a secret
transaction with our enemy.
Are you going to let
him get away with that?
His big contribution makes
up for his small mistake.
Father, I hope you will give
him the right punishment.
It is clear that Lord
Hae has committed a sin.
But I praise his loyalty for Goguryeo.
Additionally, this incident
must stay confidential...
to protect the dignity
and face of our country.
Your Majesty.
Being able to get away
with committing a crime...
already harms the dignity of Goguryeo.
Princess. My goodness.
I want the historians to write this down.
No matter how much power
or wealth one may have,
anyone who violates the
law will be held responsible.
That is the discipline...
that King Jumong had
when he built Goguryeo.
And it is the principle...
that King Pyeongwon
follows as he rules the country.
Although I have announced
to keep this confidential,
Lord Hae will still have to take
responsibility for his actions.
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Strike one!
Strike two!
I have sinned greatly.
I have sinned greatly. Strike three!
Strike four!
At this rate, the next person
will either be me or you.
Lord Jin.
Strike five!
How is saving the face of a criminal...
considered a punishment?
We are talking about the
head of the Sono Tribe.
It is already a big punishment...
I have sinned greatly.
for a man like him to go through this.
I have sinned greatly.
I have sinned greatly.
Strike seven!
Strike nine!
The Princess keeps acting out.
Are you going to let her
keep behaving that way?
Your Highness.
Calm down.
I safely sent the women
home along with new clothes...
and some money.
Those who live far away
got escorted by my soldiers.
Thank you.
I would not have been able
to save them without you.
Then do you finally believe
that I will stand on your side?
Yes.
But I am certain Gochuga
is very angry now.
I will try to find a way...
to stop him from sending
you to the borderline.
No, that is between me and my father.
You do not need to worry about it.
I forgot to thank your
friend for leading the way.
Please thank the country bumpkin for me.
You could have let it go.
You did not have to punish him.
He committed a crime.
I could not let it slide.
But this will make your
subjects very upset.
I am the king.
Must I care about how they feel?
I heard the Princess will no
longer be confined in Magnolia Hall.
Confinement: FORBIDDING
SOMEONE TO LEAVE A CERTAIN AREA
Good going.
That will only bring
bigger chaos to the palace.
My Queen.
Go and bring my medicine.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What is it? Do you wish to
say something to me too?
Yes.
What? I think you did the right thing...
by punishing Lord Hae.
I know it was a difficult decision,
but you did what you
had to do as the King.
I truly admire your decision.
Take it away.
I do not want to drink it today.
But it will help you sleep.
I told you to take it away.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Gosh, stop sweeping. It is
only making the place dusty.
Should I come live here?
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?
Dal keeps leaving home.
So I am sure you feel lonely.
If I live here, I can sweep the yard...
and run errands for
you. It will be very nice.
Hong Mae will get upset if you leave.
She only cares about the chief all day.
She does not care about me at all.
She might move in
with him sooner or later.
You little brat.
Look at you talking
about me behind my back.
How dare you.
What? I said nothing wrong.
You are always busy
talking about the chief.
Goodness, your one-sided
love for him is hard to watch.
My goodness, did you hear that?
This is why they say it
is useless to help anyone.
Be quiet.
Have you not heard anything
about Dal and the rest?
I do not know. I think they
will be back today or tomorrow.
The hunt is lasting longer than expected.
They did not go on a hunt.
I am sure they went to the palace.
Pyeongyang Castle? Why?
Is it not obvious?
He went there to see
the Princess from afar.
My goodness, that fool.
SONGHWADANG
He went to bed early.
I have something to tell him.
He does not want anyone to disturb him.
Okay.
I want the historians to write this down.
No matter how much power
or wealth one may have,
anyone who violates the
law will be held responsible.
That is the discipline...
that King Jumong had
when he built Goguryeo.
And it is the principle...
that King Pyeongwon
follows as he rules the country.
Your Majesty.
I will not forgive you even after I die.
You will never be able
to take over Goguryeo.
Is the daughter trying to follow...
the path where her mother fell?
What did you just say?
Eight years ago,
the Sunno Tribe was
wrongfully blamed as traitors.
They need to get back on their feet.
That is what I just said.
That is nonsense.
They say one who has
tied a knot must untie it.
The knot you tied wrong...
can only be untied by you.
This is not a matter you
should be concerned about.
I can tell you this because it is me.
If it were not for them, I would be dead.
Those people who saved
me eight years ago...
If you give up now,
that will be the end of Goguryeo.
They saved my life this time as well.
I am the daughter of their nemesis,
but even after realizing it,
they gladly looked after me.
They are kind-hearted...
and faithful, both back then and now.
Please restore their honor...
and accept them as one of us.
If you resolve their old resentment,
they will be your reliable supporters.
But there will be a strong backlash.
You are the king.
Who will dare overturn a
decision made by the king?
The king...
has to listen to 10,000
resentments with his 2 ears,
but he has only one
mouth to govern the nation.
Your order is the law of this nation.
The Sunno Tribe and I...
will be your supporters.
The Sunno Tribe?
Are you not well?
I heard you went to bed early last night.
How can I be so well...
when I feel depressed?
Are you upset because
you had to endure shame...
at the Five Tribe council?
Or is it because...
the silver was transferred
to the national treasury?
Do not worry.
I did not say anything about
the silver to the Princess.
As your son, I should
not harm your reputation...
before I set off a long journey.
You do not need to go to the borderline.
Pardon?
The order has been withdrawn,
so you do not need to leave.
What is the reason?
I just chose to grant your wish.
I suggest you keep trying...
to win the Princess' favor.
Your son drowned...
and your husband is
bedridden after a stroke.
My goodness. You are
truly good. That is all true.
What can I do to change my fate?
I will write you a
talisman. Wait downstairs.
I will. Thank you.
You should call it a day.
Each time you channel your energy,
your life span... Are you...
able to attack and kill the King?
I can.
I will behead the King.
With the assassins we have left,
we cannot even scale the palace walls.
Our only option...
is to make the King come and see me.
This is so embarrassing.
I cannot believe I am
locked up in my own home.
It is a good excuse to get some rest.
We will hear some good news soon.
Good news, you say?
What are you talking about?
Gochuga will not let the
Princess act out any longer.
He will be thinking of a plan.
A plan?
A plan?
What happened this
time that we were called...
at the crack of dawn?
Every single day feels like
I am treading on thin ice.
Lord Hae cannot be here
because he was told to repent.
He told a chief of one of
the Five Tribes to repent?
Things are getting worse and worse.
Here comes His Majesty.
Dealing with the recent
Sono Tribe incident...
weighed greatly on my heart.
I know how loyal and hard-working
the chiefs of the Five Tribes are,
so it made me feel even worse.
Therefore, I thought
about the kind of authority...
the Five Tribe council should
have as the core of our government...
I wish to speak, Your Majesty.
Before we hear your wise
ideas regarding the government,
I would like to speak.
What do you wish to discuss?
It is about the Princess' marriage.
Her marriage?
Is that true? You do not
have to leave for the border?
Yes.
I will remain in Pyeongyang
Castle as Head of Special Forces.
That is great. It is great news.
But...
do you honestly think it is great?
Why did he suddenly change his mind?
I am not sure.
I can never tell what he is thinking.
Princess. Open the door.
Princess.
You are together.
What brings you here?
Seeing you together after what I heard...
makes me think this is a pretty picture.
What are you talking about?
You two are such a great match.
My gosh, honestly.
Your Highness. Wait...
You knew, didn't you, Master Go?
It is news to me too.
Do you not believe me?
When the people are overjoyed
by their princess' return,
if she were to marry as well,
it will be such a joyous occasion.
But it is too sudden.
It is not entirely unexpected, though.
The marriage of the kingdom's...
two main families, the Gyeru
Tribe and the royal family,
is a long-standing tradition.
That is preposterous.
I have no intention of marrying.
Why are you even discussing this?
You are...
of marriageable age.
This is not for you to decide.
Are you...
not satisfied with your spouse?
If I may say about my own son,
he is not lacking as a possible
husband to the Princess.
It is not about General
Go's qualifications.
Then what is the problem?
Father.
I do not wish to... I cannot...
allow it.
When the princess is ready,
she will pick a man she wishes...
and marry with my blessing.
Their plan is...
to use my marriage to
restrict both you and me.
They wish to hold me hostage.
I know that.
How can I not know what
the sly man is thinking?
Do not worry.
Without my permission,
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.
Father.
The Princess makes him
think he has all the power.
Still, would he easily give
permission to the marriage?
If words do not work, I will use force.
You must have a grudge
regarding the recent incident.
Gochuga, if you are
planning to raise an army,
I will offer you my support.
Why are you smiling?
The marriage.
I am in awe of your scheme.
I was trying to think of...
my own way to approach the Princess.
Your own way?
I wished to go to
Hwayeongjeon. Why are we here?
You will find out when you go inside.
Gochuga.
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know whose seat that is?
It is King Pyeongwon's.
Or rather...
it is Go Yang Seong's.
Go Yang Seong: THE KING'S NAME
How dare you?
Is anyone outside?
Guards!
I sent away your bodyguards.
Behold.
Eight years ago, that arrow speared...
your woman's heart.
A man crazed by jealousy...
killed his own wife and people.
Does he deserve to sit up here?
The only reason you were
able to play king until now...
was because I allowed it.
How... How dare you, Go Won Pyo.
However...
if you forget your place and act out,
I must oust you immediately.
Even if the sky caves in,
I will not permit the marriage. Never.
I said that permission is mine to give.
When the day breaks, the
people will hear the good news.
Because the King will have
announced the Princess' engagement.
You will never get your own way.
Do you truly know what my wish is?
It is to get rid of the
troublesome Princess...
and to bring down...
your sickly son from his seat as heir.
Would you like to see me get my way?
You cannot do that.
They are my unfortunate children.
Which is why...
I am offering a chance.
A chance for you and your
offspring to save your lives.
That salt must be heavy.
We need at least this much to
last a season at Ghost Valley.
Let me help you carry it.
No way. It is fine. Leave it.
The man should do the heavy lifting.
Us Gokturks do not
discriminate women from men.
This is Goguryeo.
You should be treated like a woman.
Well... I never asked
to be treated specially.
What does that say?
"The King's son-in-law"?
What is that? "The King's son-in-law"?
"The King's son-in-law"?
What is that about? What is going on?
What? The Princess should marry.
Is she still single? Too bad.
Do you know what this is
about? The King's son-in-law.
I just left the King's chambers.
You will not be allowed to see him.
I still must.
Your Highness.
I may not be the best Daedaero,
but I am still the King's subject.
If you have a command,
please call on me at any time.
He said no one is allowed in.
Step aside.
Your Highness.
Father, it is Pyeonggang.
Do you hear me, Father?
What is this about? A royal wedding?
I will never become a
member of the Gyeru Tribe.
Father! Please rescind your command!
Father!
Let go of me!
Your Highness. Do not touch me.
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?
It is cold. Come to Magnolia Hall.
Leave me be. Your Highness.
Oh, dear...
What is the problem?
Do you truly have no idea?
Did you not say so yourself that...
you would gain the Princess'
favor and make her yours?
I gave you an opportunity.
You should be grateful.
This is an arranged marriage.
How am I to be grateful?
I refuse to be manipulated.
Whether it is for riches,
the want of power,
or maybe even one's good looks,
every marriage in the
world is about manipulation.
Taming the Princess with this
marriage is good enough for me.
But...
what is it that you truly want?
Without my permission,
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.
Your Highness. The Crown Prince is here.
Pyeonggang. Get up. You might faint.
Pyeonggang.
Go Won Pyo.
I will not forgive you.
The Princess may try to fight,
but she will not be able to
go against the royal wedding.
If Gochuga becomes in-laws with the King,
he will become even more powerful.
Do not worry.
I know he will...
take Prince Geon Mu's
side, not the crown prince.
You do not think the rumor
going around the palace...
is true, do you?
Gochuga and the late Queen Yeon...
had a special... Father!
The time is out of joint.
Be mindful of your conduct.
I hear the Five Tribe council is
choosing the King's son-in-law.
No matter how many
sons of noble there are,
they will end up choosing General Go.
I hear General Go will not accede
to becoming king's son-in-law.
My goodness. Your Highness.
What are you all waiting for?
Take her back to her chamber.
Your Highness. Wake up, Your Highness.
Taming the Princess with this
marriage is good enough for me.
But...
what is it that you truly want?
Notify Jangbaek herb store...
of my sister's condition and
tell them to send medicines.
Pardon? But...
Lord Hae and his daughter
are put on probation.
She is the best one in Goguryeo
when it comes to handling herbs.
I will give you permission
as a crown princess.
So send someone right away.
Yes, Your Highness.
Hang in there, Pyeonggang.
We need to stop the royal wedding.
But when Gochuga mentioned
it, you said it was a clever move.
Why the sudden change in thought?
Gochuga already has
control over the state affairs.
If he takes the princess
as his daughter-in-law...
and seizes control of the royal household,
the Sono Tribe,
as well as the Gwanno Tribe
will become their servants.
Power is like water.
Once it becomes
stagnant, it will rot away.
We will need to come up with an idea...
to defend ourselves against
Gochuga's arbitrary executions.
Quietly and secretly.
My Lord, someone came
looking for you from Magnolia Hall.
Magnolia Hall? Are you saying
the princess is looking for Mo Yong?
Yes, My Lord.
We need to lower her fever first.
We will help her recover her
cold as we watch her condition,
but first, please bring me
some warm water and a bowl.
Yes, I will.
Father...
Please...
do not turn away from me.
Father...
Welcome back! You guys are back.
I thought you went to get some
groceries, but it took you so long!
It must have been a lot
of work. Put them here.
My gosh, what is this? It is salt!
Where is Dal?
I have no idea.
Where are you going? Just stay here.
Did something happen at the Capital?
Not at all.
We had nothing much to do
there, so we were really bored.
You must be Pung Gae. Yes, I am here.
Oh, I brought some salt.
Why did you come alone? Where is Dal?
There were some leathers left to sell.
How dare you lie to me?
He could not go hunting,
so there is no leather to sell at all.
Well... Where is Dal?
What is he up to right
now? Tell me everything.
LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES TO
BECOME THE KING'S SON-IN-LAW
Who will become the King's son-in-law?
I am sure all the sons
of noble will apply for it.
Nonetheless, the best one
among them is General Go Geon.
Are you kidding me?
The Five Tribe council
needs to evaluate them.
Does that mean Gochuga
will evaluate his own son?
You are right. Then it would not be fair.
Are you up, Your Highness?
What are you doing here?
Did Nanny call you?
Lady Gongson went to decoct the herbs.
You will get better soon if you
take the medicine for a day or two.
I hope you will get better
soon, Your Highness.
I will leave now.
Mo Yong.
Yes, Your Highness.
All your hard work will go in vain.
You are a criminal who violated
the law, no matter what you do.
That is why I understand
how you feel more than anyone.
I committed a crime under duress.
And you have to get
married against your will.
We are undergoing the same thing.
Are you saying you committed
the crime because of Gochuga?
He has absolute power.
Who would dare to go against him?
If you cannot win, then run
away from him, Your Highness.
No, I am not going anywhere.
If I were to run away
because of such a small matter,
I would not have come back.
I am sure Dal is going to cause trouble!
Before he does,
we need to do something, Chief.
He is not someone to act rashly.
Pung Gae said he saw him too!
The face of our nemesis
of the Gyeru Tribe!
Is that not true, Pung Gae?
On top of that, that lady
is going to get married.
So Dal must not be in his right mind.
If what you are saying is true,
we do not have any good ways to stop him.
We need to bring him back
here even if we have to drag him.
Calm down.
Let us trust Dal and patiently
wait until he comes back.
My goodness. This is why I told
him not to go to the mountain...
nor the Capital. Forget it, then.
I told him this so many times,
but there is nothing I
can do. Here, grab this.
Who is he?
He is Ga Jin's father.
The father of that fox who seduced my Dal?
You are quite harsh.
Do you expect me to say nice things then?
How poorly did you raise your daughter...
that she is causing
trouble wherever she goes?
What is wrong with my daughter?
She is shrewd, and
she has a heart of gold.
Then why did a good-hearted
daughter of yours seduce my son?
"Seduce"?
My gosh. Your son is the one
who fell head over heels for her.
You old fogey. How dare
you babble on about my son?
"Old fogey"? Look at this old fart.
I called you old because you are!
Yeom Deuk! Please calm down!
Darn you! Darn you!
You think you are young?
Darn you, you old fogey! Darn you!
Darn it. Darn you! Educate
your daughter properly!
What is wrong with them?
I hear Ga Jin is getting married.
"Married"? That means
there will be a royal wedding.
Then what about Dal?
That is what I am saying.
So I do not think those
two will become in-laws.
My goodness.
I have a favor to ask.
I have something to tell you too.
Come on in.
Do not worry.
Without my permission,
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.
Are you not satisfied with your spouse?
I thought you were not feeling well.
When you have too many
thoughts, you need to move.
My fever broke though.
Why do you not teach me a move?
I will no longer...
be your master of swordsmanship.
From now,
I will be your husband, Your Highness.
What did you just say?
Please marry me.
I will always be...
on your side no matter what.
Our parents might be ill-fated,
but we are different.
If we come together as one,
we can change Goguryeo...
and make a better world.
I will pretend I did not
hear what you just said.
It is a marriage of convenience.
That is right. I know the
deep resentment you have...
against my father.
But there is no one else...
who knows you better than I do.
That is because I have
been watching you...
and loving you for a long time.
I will protect you...
without a change of heart.
Please accept...
my proposal.
I am sorry.
Even if it is not a
marriage of convenience,
I cannot accept your feelings.
I will take care of my father.
I will stop him from defaming you...
and the King. This is not about that.
I already have someone else...
in my heart.
My heart has been telling me...
that he is the one for a while.
If I do not see him, I feel worried.
When I see him, I feel bad for him.
You have feelings...
for that mere country bumpkin?
That is right.
He is my man.
He is the one whom I
will share my fate with.
I will never...
give up on you.
You are willing to marry the princess?
Is that what you are saying? Yes.
Please proceed with
the royal wedding quickly.
Why did you change your mind?
Even yesterday, you seemed not to want it.
If...
there is someone I strongly desire,
I must have her...
even if that means I have to use force.
That is what I realized.
Even if the princess
refuses until the end?
She will eventually become mine.
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES
We need to make a dress for your wedding.
The wedding where the bride is
bartered is not a joyous occasion.
We do not need any more
misfortune in the royal family.
Help me. We will stop the Gyeru
Tribe from abusing their power,
and I will punish Go Won Pyo in the end.
You are actually the son of On Hyeop?
On Hyeop, you are tormenting
me even after your death?
You ended up bringing
disgrace on your father!
You are no longer my daughter.
Royal wedding and marriage
of convenience are all over.
What do you mean it is over?
I will kill anyone who gets
in my way and the princess!
I am sorry.
I can track it down,
whether it is a lie or not.
Chil Gu?
This is the only way I can
avoid the royal wedding.
Please forgive your father.
Father.
He is my husband.
We got married.
He was the general of Goguryeo.
He was a commander.
I am the son of General On Hyeop,
the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,
My name is On Dal.
