When Cheryl's aunt dies, the family asks Larry to write the obituary. But when it gets printed in the newspaper, an unfortunate typo lands Larry in the hot seat.
But thank you.
Did you fly in from Florida?
No, her sister and her sister's boyfriend and her parents flew in.
Thanks for the hotel room. l appreciate that.
Not that long.
Becky really wants to get married.
And l'm not into it.
My gosh. And then you couldn't do it after she killed herself.
What should l say?
Just tell her you're not happy.
That's very good, that works. l've never actually used it myself, but l think it works.
No, l thought l saw a bug, that's creepy.
We never had this conversation, by the way. l won't say anything.
You would be very surprised how broken up he is about this.
Thank you.
You could stay another day in the hotel.
That would be nice, because we hate flying. l don't even like to drive.
There's anything you want to add, tell me, l'll get it in. lt's not gonna be funny, is it? lt's not gonna be funny. lt'll be very tasteful and appropriate. l love you, too. lt's very hard to extricate myself from mourners. lf l didn't have to, l wouldn't.
Doesn't matter what it is, it's a nice gesture. lt really is.
Any ideas?
No.
Let's do this obituary thing, okay?
That's for sure. l'm glad l don't live here.
You don't have to stay here and mourn.' l know we're all going to miss Louise.
But we have to continue.
Can't go on.
Must go on.
Laughter is a great healer and you've gotta have a smile.
He requested me to do five minutes.
You know who's funny? That Carrot Top.
Have you seen that guy?
He comes on The Tonight Show once in a while.
Okay. l'll go get the paper. l have unlimited mileage, l can drive anywhere.
He knows what he's doing.
Gives him pleasure to use the rental car anyway.
You could move over a little bit now because he's not sitting there anymore.
Three, four. 'Look what they did to my Santino. 'Gladys, George, look what they did.'
What did he say? What happened?
We could've worked through that.
Did he say anything to you? l know how much he likes you,
Everybody stay here, okay?
Gladys, you're here, okay, Barbara?
George, right here.
Gladys, l'll be right back. l'm just gonna get a birthday present. 45 minutes. l'd like to buy a pair of sunglasses. lt's a birthday present.
Elizabeth Taylor wears the exact same glasses.
Elizabeth Taylor? You're kidding.
How would one go about
You know, there's a card store upstairs.
You could maybe go there.
You could check. lf you're gonna go get that stuff, you might wanna get a bow.
And a card.
A bow and a card?
You don't have to have a card, l'm just saying.
Where do you get them? ls that in the same store as the scissor and the scotch tape? l really don't know.
Boy, this is very complicated.
What?
What? We got a paper, that's what. 'Devoted sister, beloved cunt''?
They have proofreaders at papers.
The woman leads a decent life and this is how she ends up? ''Beloved cunt''?
Excuse me for a second. l just got off the phone with Craig, and l wanted see if this rings any bells. 'lt wasn't her mother who died, it was just her aunt. 'You should break up with her today. 'You don't look happy, you should break up.'
Did you tell Craig to break up with Becky?
He talked to me, but l told him to wait till he got back to Tallahassee. l think you should just leave.
You mean for tonight?
How would one go about
You could probably go to a stationery store.
But they don't have the tape and scissor. l don't know, they might, l wouldn't bet on it, l would bring my own.
They might, honestly, l don't know, because my wife wraps everything.
How would you go about
That's for the paper.
Where's the Hallmark? l don't know.
All right, forget it, l'm all done here.
You don't know where the Hallmark is. l thought maybe tomorrow, if you're up to it, we'd go to the outlet center.
Happy birthday.
That was sweet of you.
What kind of present is that?
Not wrapped nicely.
My gosh, look at this.
Elizabeth Taylor wears glasses.
She has the exact same glasses. l have a prescription in my lenses.
Give me your prescription and we'll make them prescription glasses. lsn't that nice? How did the obit go?
Obituaries, it's in the back there.
Here, l'll show you how it went.
Here's how it went. 'Louise Hoenin, devoted sister, beloved cunt''?
What? lt says that in the paper?
Let me see this.
You said ''aunt,'' l wrote down ''aunt'.
Point well taken, l'll have them write a letter of apology.
She kicked me out of the house.
She kicked you out?
You'll stay here.
Mom and Dad are here anyway.
Larry, let me see those glasses again. l can't see through them, but l can get an idea.
They're beauties.
Elizabeth Taylor. lt's no joke.
We'll get that taken care of. lt shouldn't take too long, you know?
They look good, though.
See, Mom, l told you, he's got a very, very sweet side.
Very.
Yeah?
You copped a feel off my mom, you gotta go. l copped a feel off your mom?
What are you saying to me?
She was moping around. l'm saying, ''What's the matter?'
She said, ''Larry touched my bosom for several seconds.'
Schmuck. Listen to me for a second.
What?
We're in the kitchen.
She wanted to try on the sunglasses again.
She's all freaked out.
You gotta go.
Are you kicking me out?
All right, look, set the alarm.
Do you know how to set the alarm?
She rubbed up against the back of my hand. l apologized, it's not about that. lt's not about that.
You gotta get out of here l'll be out of here early in the morning.
Grab a bagel from the kitchen and get out. l won't grab anything, l'll just walk out.
Your mother thinks l touched her breast?
Sweet dreams. 'Sweet dreams.' l'll dream about fucking your mother. 'Sweet dreams.' lt was the toaster and the hand.
You rubbed against me.
You're gonna wake up Sammy. lt was an accident, you rubbed up against me.
Yes, you pushed up against my hand. l didn't do anything. l think it's better. Okay, Ma?
He's gonna leave.
Please accept my apology.
Not in their kitchen, l know, it's horrible. l'll smooth it all over tomorrow.
Do me a favor.
Let me take care of the sunglasses. l know what it's called. lt's a very racist term, but l'm okay with that.
Where are you going now? l don't know, l can't go home.
Guess l'll go to a hotel.
Okay.
There's a guy in this hotel, his name's Craig Butler. l'm paying for his room. l don't want to anymore.
Wake him up, get him out, that's my room.
The room's paid for through tomorrow.
The cards have been run for this evening.
He's authorized to be there till
Our manager will work out the bill with you,
You don't have a room for me in this hotel tonight? Not one room?
Don't you always keep extra rooms for people?
Not one. You're not the first person we've turned away. l'm Frank Sinatra, Jr., you're turning me away tonight?
The Pope is being shooed out into the street.
We are filled to capacity, sir. l have a pair of sunglasses here.
Elizabeth Taylor wears these sunglasses.
Thank you, sir, l wear prescription.
Thank you very much.
Just curious.
Thanks for ratting me out to Becky, really appreciated it. l did not rat you out.
You told her everything we talked about.
And l told you not to say anything.
That's your problem.
Are you going to beat me up?
Excuse me, are you guests at the hotel this evening?
Excuse me, one at a time. lt would be best if you go back to your room.
Very good, thank you very much.
He's here because l'm paying for him.
Sir, do you have a room key here at the Roosevelt?
Just pretend we're blind.
What's the matter with that?
That's what it is for them.
My wife is home. l've been ordered off the phone.
Okay, l'll meet you there in 10 minutes.
All right, very good.
What did the doctor say?
He said that l have dermatitis.
But if l get this filled, and put it on, it'll be fine.
You don't have to back up. l don't think it's contagious. ls it contagious?
But he said if l take this three times a day, rub it on, it'll be fine. l'm passing it over to you because l'm hoping you'll take it to the drugstore. l have to meet Richard Lewis first.
But l'll have to come all the way back to get you. lt's right by the restaurant. l'd rather not take my car.
Can't Rosa take you?
She drives right by there.
She's embarrassed me a couple of times, 'l don't wanna be your friend anymore.' l don't know, l just don't think a friend can just bolt from a friendship.
Cheryl and l are going out to dinner tonight.
Why don't the two of you join us?
This is a very nice gesture. Tonight?
Can you come over after dinner, have coffee and dessert at our place?
Yeah, we wanna have dessert.
We'll come over for dessert and coffee.
Justin?
Dr. Grambs, this is my friend, Larry David.
What, for 15 years already?
What do you mean, 'The whole affirmative action thing?' lt was a joke.
He's like a buddy. l know him, he's a sweetheart.
The implication being that l wasn't good enough to be a dermatologist?
No, come on, it was joke.
Do you see my point? l see it in a historical sense,
You know, Richard, l've worked too hard and too long at this. l can't do it. l don't know what his trip is, but l can't do it. l don't have any trip. No, it was joke.
And he took it the wrong way.
Why would you even make a joke about that? l don't know, l was trying to be affable. l was trying too hard.
Why even joke about it? l made a mistake. lt was a stupid thing to say. l'm a schmuck. l did a schmucky thing. l have to say, l'm not real happy
What do you think?
Yeah, sure.
Good evening, sir.
No, we're very crowded this evening, sir.
Nothing that l can think of, sir.
Things are done, right, aren't things done? l hear things are done.
From time to time.
Actually, l think we can accommodate you right now. Would you like to follow me?
Thank you.
Thank you very much. l am extremely attracted to you right now.
Women are attracted to criminals, and they do that all the time.
You could do that. Just walk around, cut in line any time you want.
All right. Do it all the time, and we'll never have to wait.
Should l feel guilty about it?
Why, because all those people are still waiting? l can't stop to think about it because l'm starving.
How can a handicapped person use a nonmotorized wheelchair? l don't get that.
What's the point to it?
To me, that's your big priority.
Maybe he likes the exercise.
Motor and nonmotor?
You can do both. You want exercise or the motor, you got it.
This way has no options.
He used to be the president of ABC.
Just don't stop.
Just keep walking and say hello.
You have to stop.
You can't just say hello, and walk on.
There's a restaurant two doors down. l'm gonna go in there. l'm gonna go to the bathroom in there.
Are you out of your mind?
No, l don't wanna say hello. l don't like those hellos.
Men's room?
Larry, Larry David.
Do you remember me, Denise Pendergrass?
Cause we had a really nice meeting.
All these years, l wondered what happened, cause l really wanted to work with you.
This is the thing. l had a couple of margaritas, but l'm not gonna hold back. l just was wondering.
What? A problem?
What are you talking about?
There's a lot of people interviewed for that.
Yeah, but, you and l, we had a rapport.
What is that about? ls it a black thing with Larry David?
There's no black thing. lt's a nothing.
No, a sister like me can see through things like this.
Maybe it was a blessing in disguise that l did not get that job. l just hope you have a very nice dinner.
Thank you, Mr Larry David.
Nice to see you. How you doing?
You guys just sitting down?
At my club, l got a member guest next month. l've got a couple of other guys.
You wanna come?
Okay, we're all set. lt's 10 days, make sure you take all 10 days.
And watch the dairy. Okay.
And l specifically said, ''No feta cheese.'
Do they have to put feta cheese in?
Take your time.
What's wrong? l think l gave the maitre d' the prescription.
This was for the maitre d.
Did you not look at it, Larry?
No, they take it and put it in their pocket.
Why would l have the $20 on me?
This was the $20 that was designated for the maitre d.
Why don't we just call your doctor?
You can't call my doctor on the weekends, lf you call his machine, it'll tell you you can't page him.
We're in the middle of dinner, Norman. or you're not gonna leave this house.'
She really needs it. Do you have it?
You'll find it in a trash can, right through those double doors.
Help yourself. l think l'm gonna be sick.
You didn't happen to see a piece of paper here earlier? l've been looking all over, Cheryl. l can't find it.
We'd sit there for eight hours.
This is a very pleasant activity.
Can you lock me in a toilet after this?
Wait a second. What about Richard's friend?
He's a dermatologist.
The guy l offended today.
The black guy? He's a dermatologist?
Yes, we're going over to Richard's anyway. l could call him and apologize.
He could phone in the prescription for us.
Yeah, let's try that.
How are you? Good to see you.
She'll be off in a second. lt's this dermatitis and it's spreading is the problem, Richard.
We've been driving all night l didn't lose it, but, whatever.
We don't have it anymore.
Why don't you call your doctor?
The thing is, we don't know any doctors, or anybody who can help her.
You were like James Earl Ray today, with this guy. l know.
This is like a nightmare call.
Honey, hello, the Davids are here.
Listen, she has a medical emergency.
Honey, baby, l'm on the phone.
We don't even know if the guy's gonna be home or not.
She has a medical emergency.
She has a tremendous rash.
You know what?
Will you hang up the phone?
Good, now we're all happy.
You're happy, he's happy, l'm happy.
She's sick and you're not, how's that?
Dr. Grambs?
Yeah, it's Lewis. l just hung up with my agent on the phone, without even saying goodbye. lt is my business.
He's funny. He didn't mean it.
He wants to apologize profusely. l need to help them. l'm lost.
Really?
You're unbelievable.
He says, ''Come over to the house.'' He can't prescribe over phone. lt's unethical.
Doctor, you're really the best.
What's your address?
Okay, thanks.
How do you get there?
Just get better.
Right turn ahead.
The navigation system. l figured it out, it's working. lt's telling us exactly how to go to the doctor's house. l can't wait to call my parents.
And he's got one, too.
Can we turn on the radio?
He's gonna be very proud of Larry, figuring out the navigation system.
Can we turn on the radio?
No, 'cause then we won't be able to hear the navigator.
Right turn ahead.
Hi, l'm Larry David. This is my wife, Cheryl.
My husband's in the living room.
Please, come in.
Please.
Please, come in. l hope we're not disturbing anything.
Excuse me, sweetie.
Let's go take a look at that.
No, l don't think so. lt was completely idiotic.
Justin, what did he say?
We'd like to hear it.
How are you doing?
Believe me, you don't wanna hear this.
What? You're kidding.
Come on, believe me, it was nothing.
You're having a nice party here.
Eat. You got peanuts and cookies. Drinks.
Larry, you're apologizing.
Come on, Larry, please, share with us.
We're very interested in hearing what you have to say. l'll make a deal with you folks, okay?
We'll tell you what it was, and then we can move on.
Guys, he's a comedian. He makes funny lines all the time. l overreacted.
And he knocked it off the top off his head.
Thank you, yes, okay.
Mr Larry David.
Twice in one evening. l'm on a roll.
Good evening. l think you better call the doctor. l'm not allowed to call the doctor on the weekend. l don't think we have a choice. l think we have to call him.
We're out of options, really.
Honey, come on. l'm gonna call him. l'm gonna page him.
We'll be home in a minute.
All right, he's paged. That's it.
What's the worst that could happen?
Hello?
Dad, l can't talk to you right now.
No, l'll call you back.
Hello? Dr. Zeppler?
My God, what a jerk this guy is.
At least we got it.
Get yourself a new doctor.
This guy's an idiot.
No, go take a hot bath, and l'll be back in 1 2, 15 minutes.
Okay.
The doctor says you just wanna get your prescriptions renewed on time, okay?
Now, in terms of this, it's just two quick shots.
Pay for that up front, okay?
And good luck with that.
Okay, Mr Brazil.
Zeppler, yes, we got that. lt's gonna be about 45 minutes to an hour, okay?
Mr Brazil. l mean, it's really, it's an emergency. l'm not kidding. lt's gonna be about 45 minutes to an hour.
You see, we have a backup.
Okay, just read all the indications on it. lt's very important, pay for that up front.
Okay, next is Guyaphone.
Okay.
Yes. ls there anything that can be done about this? 'Done''? l don't understand.
You know, l hear things are done.
Things are done?
What is this?
You think you can bribe me?
Do l look like l can be bribed?
Take your money.
Nobody bribes a pharmacist.
And he wants to have dinner with us on Thursday night.
Yeah, that way we can get rid of him.
Jeff wants to see us in his office tomorrow.
He said not to worry, he said he's got good news.
Although l don't think he'd bill it as that. l'm just curious, okay?
Why am l the one that always has to initiate sex?
You ever thought about that? l got a cramp in my foot.
But, anytime l want to have it, l can't.
Otherwise l'll be making moves all the time.
Do you want that?
That's how l'll walk around. You know, l need borders, l need boundaries.
Okay, once in a while, give it a try, that's all l'm saying, okay?
All right, okay, all right.
Why'd you call us down here for?
Good for you, Wendy, do you need help?
She had seen you in a play years ago.
And knew who you were, and liked your work.
Are you joking me?
No, l'm not, as a matter of fact, l have the script right here.
She wants Cheryl to do
The Vagina Monologues?
You can use the script on stage.
Seriously. l didn't even have to sell you.
Nancy saw this in New York and said that it's, like, the biggest hit.
You're involved with The Vagina Monologues.
Lucy Montone.
Are you working, what's going on in your life? l'm on drugs, you know, l'm all doped up. l don't do anything, yeah. lt's true, l'm a drug addict now. l'm glad l'm seeing you, because l've been thinking about you. l've been wanting to get in touch with you, and here you are, you're here.
She's an actress.
She just got this today. l've been trying to get a reading for that, and my agent's just dropped the ball. l just got lucky, and his manager really was helpful.
We used to go out.
When he stopped actually being fun, l stopped actually liking him.
Good. lt didn't go anywhere.
You know what? l'm gonna go wait in the car. l'm dying to really start reading this. lt was great meeting you.
Congratulations on this. And your marriage and all this wonderful stuff. l'd almost forgotten about that.
Do me a favor, turn the air conditioner on, make it a little cool in there.
We don't have a child, do we?
Not that l know of, and, l think l'd probably be aware of that one.
Do you have time, Larry?
Tapped out?
Do you think that's a coincidence?
You were thinking of this woman Lucy
No, not the whole time. She made a brief appearance and said, ''Goodbye.'
Was l in the mix there? l wouldn't defile you like that.
You don't know what goes on there.
You don't want any part of that world.
You don't want to be involved. lt's complimentary to you that you're not involved in that. l can degrade and defile her.
Lucy Montone is out, she's made her last appearance.
That's it.
She's like a prima donna. l don't need any prima donnas, you know.
Yeah, no exgirlfriends.
Not Lucy, not any of the exgirlfriends.
This is from Cheryl.
Yeah.
Wow. Blue Label.
Here she is. Hi, Lucy.
Yeah, l saw you in that hurricane movie.
That's sweet, but l think you're thinking of Jami Gertz.
Asteroid, hurricane, same thing.
So?
This is the best one in town, right here, it's the best one.
A good lunch, this is the place to go.
You're just a big bowl of wrong.
Good night, nurse.
You'd think l would have heard about it in school, but l didn't.
Anyway, what's going on? l'm very curious as to why you invited me to lunch.
Yep.
And, did not breathe a word of it to anyone.
Good, 'cause you're the only person l ever told about that.
Could you go with me?
Do you want me to spell it out?
Can you go with me?
You want me to go to the incest group with you?
Yeah.
What would l do there?
You'd just be there with me.
There's nobody else you feel comfortable going with?
Nobody else knows about what happened, except for, you know, my stepdad. l'm not gonna bring him.
Are you sure that you qualify with your stepfather? ls that considered incest?
God, Larry.
No, if it's your stepfather, Larry, it's considered a date.
They consider that incest.
And that's Nancy.
Nice to meet you.
Nancy's a friend of Cheryl's, and a friend of mine, too.
Just a little lunch.
Sit, why don't you sit?
We need our time alone.
We're gonna go eat.
Good to see you. And you. lt was great to see you, l knew l'd see you again. lt was nice to meet you.
Fat man.
Just representation stuff. l'll call your house, and leave it with Susie. l'll leave it at the office.
Thank you, l appreciate it, you're a good man.
You're a great guy, helping her out like that. l'm not a good man, you're a great man.
My name is Cynthia, and I'm an incest survivor.
Okay, this is the part where you guys say, 'Hello, Cynthia.'
Hello, Cynthia.
You'll get used to it, you're new. l want to commend you all for having the courage to step forward. l want you all to feel safe.
What is said in this room, stays in this room.
We have total anonymity here.
Good. On that note, if you'd like to share.
My name's Gwendolyn, and l'm an incest survivor.
Hello, Gwendolyn. lt's really scary to say that.
He looked like Tyrone Power.
There's one more event l'd like to talk about. l'm not sure if it counts. lt was my stepbrother.
Does a stepbrother count? lt's not really a blood relative. l think that l'll save it for another meeting. l've taken up a lot of time. lt really feels good to unburden myself, you know.
And l'm here. l want to scream at them, ''l'm here, l'm here. 'l'm here.'
Thank you.
Okay, next.
You're up.
Go ahead.
He lived in Great Neck.
You broke up with her?
Fine, you can go back to your Vagina Monologues. Thank you.
Speaking of, l'm supposed to meet l broke up with her. That's great. l'm not saying that.
You're supposed to meet the director tomorrow. l don't have the car.
Would you like a ride? l'll give you a ride.
No, listen, l've got to read this before l meet this woman tomorrow.
Come on, give me five minutes.
Do you think you would notice it?
Do you think it would bother you throughout the day? 'There's no pillows on this couch.' l know at night, it would have an effect at night.
What?
There are no pillows.
There's cushions to sit on, but no pillows. l saw you in a production of Company in New York years ago.
You were sensational.
Thank you.
Todd?
What are you doing here?
We can't talk about it.
Let's just wait a second.
This just seems very odd.
Listen, do you guys know each other?
Don't worry. l would never betray you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
One on her mother's side, one on her father's side.
While they did it, they were fighting over who'd guard the door.
Then she had sex with her stepbrother.
She wasn't even sure if that was incest, and l completely understood.
She even asked the group leader.
The group leader said that it is incest.
She wasn't even done, she had more.
She had to stop, she's gonna finish next week.
That's horrible, l had no idea.
The whole time they're telling us about anonymity.
You can't say anything about what's being said in the room.
Why don't you call her up? l can't call her now.
Won't she know you've told me this?
What the hell are we gonna tell her?
Right.
And l'm not gonna say a word, cross my heart. l completely understand.
Larry has laid his cards out on the table.
You've recast already?
Lucy Montone?
That was good, Rock Cop. lt was a gift from Cheryl David.
That's ironic. Are you gonna be all right driving after we drink?
Here's to the vagina.
Hi. Please come in. Good to see you.
There was an accident on the 405,
Terrible accident.
Not that l could do anything.
Both of them obviously drunk out of their minds.
She's really in bad shape.
And this car, this beautiful car.
Crushed. A '57 Chevy.
We're not gonna stay long.
We just came to wish you luck.
You only have to talk about it. Not show it.
Okay, thank you. Everybody's a comedian. l hate to run you guys out, but l need time to collect my thoughts.
Uncle and l, we'll be gone. Goodbye.
You're gonna do great.
How's my trooper?
This is the director, Wendy.
This is my uncle, Dr. Gordon.
How do you do?
The osteopath?
Yeah.
Get out of here, you fucking piece of shit.
Get out, you filthy animal.
You fucking turd. Get out of here.
How dare you?
Wait for me outside. l'll meet you after the show.
You filthy beast. You coward.
Here's Amber, everybody,
Amber, come on out.
Larry?
Just move a little bit?
I asked you to be ready when I got back.
Have you even moved since I left this morning?
Yes, of course, what are you talking about?
I got up to tip room service.
Come on, that's funny.
No, it's not funny.
It might have been funny a week ago, but enough is enough.
Maury.
Let me just finish.
No, you need to get dressed now.
Of course l'm gonna work again.
You're in the prime of your life.
All right, here's Brittany,
Brittany, come on out.
Look at that girl come out, look.
You don't know me.
Yeah, you all go fuck yourself.
That's right, yeah, come on.
Come on, yeah, come on, yeah, fuck you.
No, fuck you.
It's big.
Look at the size of this place.
This is like for the Osmonds, this place.
I didn't know why we had to sell the old place.
There's the real estate agent.
I don't know why we had to leave the hotel.
I love the hotel.
I cannot live there any longer.
It's not a house.
You never leave.
Hello, isn't this beautiful?
It's very exciting, you're gonna love it.
They are highly motivated sellers.
If you like it, we'll go back and write an offer.
And I asked them about the cash.
You could maybe be in here in days.
What, days?
Hi. Nice to meet you.
My gosh, is that the ocean?
You get used to that in two days.
We have vaulted ceilings.
What about this furniture, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Yeah, it fits perfectly in this room.
Beautiful. Beautiful house.
Breakfast every morning, sunrise.
I love the sea.
My father was an ltalian fisherman.
I saw a whale breach.
I've never seen that here before, it's very rare.
Can you shoot the whales from the terrace?
Larry David, Jay Schneider.
I'd call you when you were at Seinfeld.
I was working at the William Morris Agency.
I would call him up and pitch my clients.
How you doing? Jay Schneider.
Hi, l'm Cheryl.
Nice to meet you.
He's phenomenal, l'm a lucky guy.
Yeah, how's he doing?
Honestly, he's kind of struggling right now.
You know what, he's nothing like George.
I mean, the range of characters this guy can do.
But every sitcom needs that.
Yeah, I bet.
You got any ideas?
Anything coming down the pike?
I've got ideas, but I choose not to carry them out.
Let's get you guys in a meeting.
You should call him.
You're not doing anything, let's take a meeting.
Yeah, you're not doing anything.
That's cashmere?
I love it. I really think it's perfect.
Larry, did you love it?
I really like it, it's a nice house.
It's big, but I like it.
I love the master bedroom, the downstairs, the fireplace.
There's no way that sweater's 100 percents cashmere.
It's, like, maybe 35, 40, 50 at the most, but 100?
You feel comfortable with that?
We're not buying a sweater, we're buying a house.
Okay, listen, we have to talk about how much to offer.
You know, I love Jason.
I just don't want to go back and do TV.
No, you need to work.
I'm married, that's plenty of work.
Okay, but you need to start writing.
Just, you know, I think for your own good, for your own sanity.
Why, l'm not insane. You think l'm insane?
Listen, Richard Lewis wants me to manage him.
But I need you to be honest with me.
I'm gonna sign him, you like that.
Good.
I can't believe he didn't even mention that to me.
Hey, Tom.
Good to see you, too.
Tom Clark, Larry David.
That's good, l'm managed by a bigwig.
You're happy with the Prius?
Very happy, and the Prius is extremely happy with me.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you have to have a lot of experience for that?
It was in my blood, yeah.
I mean, it takes years to be a car salesman.
You know, I always felt l could be a great salesman.
You gotta have the gift.
Cause believe me, l could talk anybody into anything.
Except women into sex, that's one thing I can't do.
Besides that, I know how to manipulate people, l'm very good at it.
We're an honest pack, between ourselves.
To be honest with you, l like to make money.
But I love to sell cars, I really do.
Just for a day.
I don't think so.
I want to see if I can do it.
I thought that l'd be great at it.
You can't do it, you're a writer.
That's Larry David, he created Seinfeld.
Okay.
Come in and work for me.
Maybe l'll do it for two or three days.
Who knows?
What're you doing?
What are you talking about?
You're not gonna sell a car the first day.
You won't sell a car the first day.
I really appreciate this, it's like a fantasy that I have.
Thank you.
I'm pretty excited.
My gosh, that's wonderful.
No, that is no problem.
Larry just walked in, I can't wait to tell him.
Okay, bye.
You're not gonna believe this.
Yeah, it was a cash deal, there was no escrow.
I actually can't do it on Monday.
Why?
That's good, did you call Jason?
I'm selling cars.
What?
I was having lunch today with a guy who owns a Toyota showroom.
Yeah, you know, he said I could try it.
You've committed to this?
Yeah. It's only for, like, a couple of days.
Or however long I want to do it.
You can't do it on Monday.
I have to do it on Monday.
I have to show up for my first day at work.
What, am I supposed to call in sick?
That's not gonna fly.
Prius? That's ours, that's easy.
Can I help you?
What do you think?
Excuse me, sir, perhaps the Land Cruiser would interest you.
Others, they swim the English Channel.
Who's more insane?
But l'll be a little tired, too, probably.
Yeah. Alan, guess what.
Larry David just walked in.
Man, how you doing? It's great to see you.
Come on, come sit down.
What it be?
I like how our representatives got us together here.
Right, Schneider, yeah.
They set us up.
Did he tell you that I was buying his house?
Things are, you know, things are good.
You know, the acting thing is, frankly, coming a little hard.
I'd love to go back to TV, that seems good.
But I can't shake this George thing.
They all see me as George.
I mean, the thing about it is that you're not even close to George.
I tell this to people all the time.
You can't imagine what a great actor this guy is.
He is nothing like that character.
What do you mean schmuck?
I don't get that.
The yutz, the idiot.
How can you say he's a schmuck, a yutz and an idiot?
I don't see him that way, l just see him as funny.
I mean, of course, it was funny.
But he was the fall guy, the jackass role.
Doesn't know what he wants.
That's funny, that's not schmucky.
It's not an incredibly noble experiment, was it?
I don't hate the character, l'm a little tired of it.
I mean, l'm an actor.
I have a range of characters that I can play.
Why am I relegated to this?
Everywhere I go on the street,
Hey, Costanza.
Hey, jackass.
I just had this idea.
I don't know, l'll throw it out at you, okay?
For a series, an idea for a series, okay?
And he becomes embittered and grows to hate the character.
That's pretty funny.
All right, let's do it.
Come on, let's go, you wanna do it?
I'd like to.
I'm actually working.
I'm selling cars.
I start on Monday.
Hello?
See you in the new house.
Good luck.
Anything else you have?
You really do have to come back and talk to me.
I'll see you at lunch.
You know what?
My wife's name is Veronica.
This is as good as it gets.
You know, you hear Lexus.
We don't hear Camry, but that's what you should be hearing.
Tell me, what's in the engine here?
What's in it?
Big stuff, big charging, crazy pistons, nutty pistons.
Does this car have that? Is it standard?
You know, you don't have the need to tilt in this car.
I've never had a tilting need.
My wife calls it Pepe. Are we taking Pepe?
Cause we have two cars.
What kind of gas mileage am I going to get?
Depending on the city, of course.
Okay.
That's my brother's name.
What's the wheel base?
It's a thick base, it's a thick wheel base.
Roll over, are you kidding?
Look at this thing.
Jesus Christ.
Dana.
Dana, that's my middle name,
Larry Dana David.
What is the difference between the GT and the GTS?
Hi, can I help you folks?
That might be for me, one second.
No, okay.
I want to find out more about the car.
What the hell are you doing over here?
You're fucking up my shit.
Because she likes the car, she wants to be happy in it.
Maybe she won't be able to afford the car if she takes it off the lot.
I'm really not interested in buying today, okay?
What? What are you doing? Shirley?
I'm the cocreator of the show.
No, it's true.
Please, buy one, please?
You'll sell a lot of them, you're a good salesman.
Cheryl?
Hi.
Isn't this weird, coming home to your new house?
Yeah, hi.
Did you sell a lot of cars?
You know, that's not how the business works.
You know, you don't just sell them.
Tell me, I have been unpacking all day.
House seems different than it did the other day.
Yeah, it's definitely different.
It feels strange, that's all.
Maybe, I don't know.
What's that noise?
Do you hear a noise?
Yeah.
What is it?
I can't sleep with that.
You'll get used to it, just ignore it.
Yes, it did, you'll get used to this.
I'm going to be up all night with this thing.
Gotta be fresh in the morning.
Told you I didn't trust that Schneider.
It's like you're driving a bus up there.
With the big, round steering wheel like that, you know.
Makes you, gives you a little ego boost.
You've got a great view.
You get the wood grain, we might do this today.
Could you please excuse us for a minute?
Would please excuse us for a second?
I'll meet you outside.
Go outside, go outside, okay?
What did you just say?
I was about to take him to the manager's office.
What are you, fucking Willy Loman?
What are you doing here?
He tells me you're here selling cars, which I say has gotta be a joke.
But l'm here because you told him l'm high maintenance?
And what if he does?
No, you won't get the remake of From Here To Eternity.
I thought I had dark secrets?
What the hell is this about?
Is that a cashmere sweater?
This guy had the same one.
My word's not good enough for you?
You call Jeff and tell him l'm not high maintenance.
What the hell is going on here?
That's it, Larry, you're fired.
I locked him up and I wish you could have heard it. It was beautiful.
Leave.
You don't really hear it very well
When we're in bed, that's when I hear it.
I don't hear it during the day.
Can you come back tonight?
Wait, what?
Yeah, I could, l just have to call and get a sitter.
He just says he has to call and get a sitter.
Why don't we discuss this and we will let you know, okay?
Okay.
I think l'm going to call
You are? That is good news.
Why not? Look at you, back in the saddle.
Everybody knows that.
What happens with deaths and babies?
You go all night.
How are you?
What are we doing here?
How come we didn't go to your office?
I'll have a decaf.
Thank you.
Wouldn't you love that?
I left Susie last night.
It was a whole big thing,
I'm going to a hotel, don't call me.
Yeah.
Holy cow.
I mean, it was a long time coming.
What kind of things? What do you mean?
Like sexual.
They're not horrible things that involve anything that's against the law.
Stuff that you don't want her to repeat.
I don't want her to repeat.
This is sexual blackmail.
Sexual blackmail.
That is just awful.
I've been on the bottom.
You know, that's it.
Not even with your wife.
Look what's happening with your wife.
You protected yourself ahead of time.
I don't tell my wife anything, l don't confide in my wife.
I don't trust anybody.
I just treat her like an acquaintance.
Do you think I want her blabbing about me to people?
If we got divorced tomorrow, she'd have nothing to say.
Or maybe she could say l hate a couple of people, but that's it.
Susie will know all about it.
She's gonna be there?
Yeah, she probably will be there. You're not pushing secret codes and all that.
She'll eat me alive.
Just grab my stuff.
I owe you big time.
No, you don't owe me.
I'll go later today.
My God. You would not believe this article.
You would not believe what a political agenda AAA has.
Honestly.
We're supporting this?
You should read this.
I'm going to.
I'm not quiet, you're reading.
Are you thinking about sex?
What the hell are you talking about? No.
Whenever you're quiet, you're usually thinking about sex.
I'm not thinking about sex.
I'm just curious.
It's kind of kinky.
You just said, That's kind of kinky.
Do you think l'm kinky?
I'm not kinky.
First of all, I didn't say I wanted to have sex in the afternoon.
You said that, why do you say that?
You got a lot going on in there.
Like, sick things going on, is that what you think?
Are there sick, twisted things going on?
No, not at all.
I don't know where you get that from.
I'm just thinking about Jeff, that's all.
For the show?
Yeah, we're gonna get together.
Do you believe that I might be getting back into network television?
I think it's great.
All right.
I mean, he can't stop talking about it.
We gonna hook up and talk about the show?
That's what l'm calling about.
Great, where do you want to do this?
Would you mind coming here?
Okay, all right, l'll meet you there.
I'm always going.
Nobody's ever coming to me.
I've never had a meeting in my house or in my office.
I don't even need chairs in front of my desk.
Nobody ever sits there.
Every meeting, l'm traveling.
I'd know that tush anywhere.
Jabroni, open the window.
No, sir, we were playing
Cowboys and lndians.
You know what you're looking at?
Yeah, 71350359.
That's impossible.
When?
Okay, I want to get it reinstated.
No, she had no authorization to do that.
No, that's my wife.
No, I don't want to cancel it.
All right, thank you very much.
It goes through, in front of your other tire.
Your back tire.
And use the crank, it makes it easier.
Which, there's two cranks.
You got to loosen the lug nuts first.
You mean, before I lift it?
Am I too close to the curb?
Do you know anything about changing a tire?
You want to help me change a tire?
Could use a little help.
No? Need a little assistance.
I never took a shop class and I need a little help.
I'm just coming flat out and saying, Help me.
Anybody want to help $25, $30? $30 to change a tire.
Okay, $35. $35 to change this tire for me, right now.
I'll give you $35.
I'll give you $10 for a response.
For a verbal response, $10.
Anybody want to make $10 and respond verbally?
No?
Then he calls me a bald turd.
Now?
Yeah, in a couple of minutes, he's gonna be here.
All right, did you get a license plate or anything?
The guy's license is 14 THOR.
Yeah, who else would have a plate like that?
That voice.
The description is exactly the same as what you're saying.
Big, huge guy, long, blond hair.
Jesus, am I fat.
It looks like you've put on a couple of pounds.
Horrendous.
I'll tell you, you want to do it tomorrow?
I don't think there's that much to go over.
We'll get into it.
I was kind of thinking maybe tomorrow we could do it in my office in Santa Monica.
No, that's okay, let's not do that.
We'll do it here. This is good, this works.
Yeah, it kind of works a little better for me if you come here.
It's a little easier.
I can focus on it a little better.
I got a very nice office.
You'll be able to focus on anything.
I got a very comfortable chair.
I got blackboards up there, we can write it all out.
You know, it'll be a breeze.
It's not the office, l'm very low maintenance.
We were supposed to have a meeting.
And we haven't had a meeting.
Let's start by doing what we set out to do.
Let's accomplish that, let's have a meeting, at my office.
Yeah, the driving you got done good.
But that's a little out of balance now.
Cause I did my drive.
It's not out of balance because you were driving and I was waiting.
The important thing is we didn't meet.
There's a lot to do while waiting but nothing while driving.
We said we'll meet at my office and have a meeting.
We attempted to have the meeting, but it was aborted.
This is not a meeting about the show.
This is about having a meeting.
I know, but the intention is the same, don't you understand?
The driving is what we're talking about.
You keep coming back to this insane thing with driving.
We had a singular plan.
You could drive around the world, we still haven't had a meeting.
What did you do? You canceled AAA?
What happened to you?
Why didn't you tell me you were canceling AAA?
After that article, how could I not?
I was going to tell you when you got home.
That's great, I had to change a tire.
And then, look at this.
I got to go change my clothes.
I got to go to Jeff's house and get his clothes.
Why did you tell Wanda she has a big ass?
I didn't say she had a big ass, okay.
I yelled out the window and I said, l'd know that tush anywhere.
Why would you do that?
Why would you even comment about her ass?
What's the big deal?
You got a really big ass, it's the same.
Yeah, I was just being nice.
You don't yell a comment about a woman's ass. l could have said, l'd know that tush anywhere.
You shouldn't say anything at all.
What if I did say she has a big ass?
That's not terrible.
What's the matter with a big ass?
I like big asses, there's no problem.
You like big asses?
I don't mind a big ass.
No, not necessarily big.
How big do you like them?
Because mine is really big, and l like them big.
It's not really big, it's a good size.
You said, l love big asses and I like yours.
There are a lot of things about you I don't know.
What are you, crazy, no.
I didn't say deviant.
Don't say I have an ass fetish, you got nothing on me.
What?
Come on in.
You know who I am? Okay.
I thought I had to turn around, and show you my big ass.
You completely, completely misinterpreted that.
No, I didn't say big ass, l was just saying hello.
Is that how you say hello?
Is that it? Hey, big ass.
Or Hey, Assy, or Hey, I know your ass.
What is that, that's not how you say hello, is it?
That's not so.
You are an ass man.
Obsessed with asses?
I am not obsessed with asses.
Okay, Assy.
And why is that shit all over you?
What you been doing, looking for asses?
All in the bleachers and stuff,
Where's the ass?
If it isn't Jeffrey's messenger boy.
He is such a slimy, spineless creature that he sends you to do his dirty work.
Don't you resent it?
No, l'm fine.
All right, let's get this over with, come on.
He can't even face me, that fat fuck.
It's not awkward, there's no secrets.
Honest, it's not awkward, l'm very comfortable.
What are you talking about?
He thinks I don't know this shit.
What did he tell you, what did he say?
Did he tell you I kicked him out?
He thinks I don't know about that porn stash.
Take all this.
He's gonna need this in the hotel.
He told me that he doesn't want any of this.
Yeah, Freak That Booty, Big Ass Momma, all his favorites.
Think I don't know about this crap?
You're into this shit, too?
You're into the kinky Big Ass Momma crap?
I thought I recognized that woman from the back.
Your perverse, fat fuck manager, you know, what he makes me do?
Who's that?
Susie, what's going on?
Where's Jeff?
All right, Jeffrey is at a hotel,
Larry is bringing the clothes.
I'm taking the clothes to the hotel.
I want to talk, could I go with you, to the hotel?
I want to go with you.
No, you'll get excited, you're overworked, stop it.
I want to see my boy.
You know what, take Mom to the hotel.
Dad, you stay here with me.
Okay, very good.
We'll take care of everything.
Why did you just throw them in the trunk on top of a dirty old tire?
What's wrong with me? is the question.
Why would anybody do that?
I don't have a closet in my house.
I'm used to throwing things.
Throwing them on the floor.
You're disappointed in me.
I'm disappointed. Now what's this?
Loose fat, as fast as you can.
Yeah, really.
In my day, nobody got divorced.
What are you doing?
You like that old car.
Can I help you with that?
That's okay.
Jeff, darling.
What's the trouble here?
One second, Mom. Drop them down there.
Your father is just all broken up about this.
We'll talk about it.
Go up to Room 818.
Here you go, Room 818.
I'll be up there in a second, and we'll talk about everything.
I've come all this way.
Go with him and l'll be up.
I'll be up there.
Thanks for the ride.
What happened with Susie?
Guys, dad's gonna run up to the bathroom.
Nothing, she's a lunatic.
Now you know why l'm here.
Remember earlier today you said that you owed me one?
I actually have a rather bizarre request.
I want you to go outside, there's a station wagon out there.
What?
It says 14 THOR on the license plate.
It's a red station wagon, it's in front, you can't miss it.
All right, you'll be here, right?
I'll be here, yeah. Thank you.
Guys.
How you doing?
Your dad's that wrestler, isn't he?
All the matches are set up beforehand.
The winners are all predetermined.
Exactly, fake.
That's exactly the word l'm looking for.
Dad's kind of a big fake.
You know what he is?
That's right, the whole thing's a big phony boloney.
Everybody knows that.
Nobody thinks it's real.
You tell him the bald turd said hello, okay?
Hi.
What have you been up to today?
No, we can't seem to agree on the locus equidistant of points.
I suggested a restaurant, he thought it was too close to me.
Of course you can't.
And the industry people as well.
Hi, Cliff.
I just couldn't pick out an outfit.
Just stop it.
It's actually the truth. I'm not even joking.
I saw the marquee.
Instead of spelling that out?
I'm gonna get a picture of that, too.
Yes, you have to get a picture.
Very excited.
Where did you come up with the idea?
Hey, how's Cheryl's present coming?
It's just beautiful.
One of the most beautiful bracelets l've made, I have to say.
You've got to go.
Particularly west of the river, north a little, it's unbelievable.
And is it just a bunch of people?
Yeah, it's you and guides, in a group.
It's a large group.
They'll put together different groups to go out there and do it.
But that's why you go, right?
Forgot my napkin.
You know, it's etiquette.
Very important. Must put the napkin on.
Okay, I think l'll have the grilled salmon.
Grilled salmon, all right.
I think l'm just gonna get a Cobb salad.
Okay. Cobb salad.
And I want to make just a couple of substitutions if that's okay?
No eggs.
Take it easy.
Blue cheese on the side.
I'm getting a David salad.
Yeah, it is a David salad.
And l'll get agitation, if you can.
I'm the Cobb of Cobb salad.
No, I am not lying about this.
My grandfather was a chef.
And the word got out.
That's how the Cobb salad was born.
I can tell you this, l'm not gonna do it again if you're at the table.
We were talking about what?
I want to get out in the rough.
Right. Amazon.
He went for a hunting trip.
You know, my grandfather's name was Harold Bingo.
He invented Bingo. Are you aware of that?
Do you move your camp or is it a base camp?
I'm not kidding.
We can talk about anything, they don't have any idea.
Get their own table.
Doesn't make a difference.
Larry, how you doing?
Donald, good to see you.
I don't play golf.
Larry, come on.
Go get a seat.
See what's up.
What is that? I don't know that.
Yeah, listen to this.
That's pretty.
Excuse me.
Are you Jewish?
Are you Jewish?
You wanna check my penis?
Is that what you wanna do?
My real question is, what were you whistling?
You, sir, won $100.
Yes.
I do hate myself, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish.
No, it doesn't have anything to do with being Jewish.
Yes. Hitler's favorite composer.
They got a mental asylum a couple of blocks away.
I suggest you go and check yourself in.
Where's your Judaism?
Judaism? Where are you?
Where are you, Judaism?
How can you have this attitude?
That you're better?
They should put a muzzle on you.
You're foaming at the mouth.
Please, thank you.
Yeah, he lives right by you.
Two streets away in your neighborhood.
We should get a seat. Come on.
Can you keep it down?
Hey, l'm allowed to eat popcorn.
Stop it.
I just welled up.
Mazel tov. Mazel tov.
Congratulations.
I mean, perfect.
Fantastic.
I can't believe that you had that guy
I know it's freezing 'cause you can see the smoke coming out of his mouth.
Is it smoke? What comes out of your mouth in cold water?
You really like that?
It was good.
We should go out for a drink, you guys.
Larry, probably not, right?
You have a big day tomorrow.
He has to get his sleep.
What you got going on tomorrow?
Nothing, l'm just sitting around.
I'm not doing anything.
Tomorrow, l'm sitting around.
I'm not doing anything.
Sitting around?
Listen, thank you for coming.
Bye.
And everything was perfect.
Are you happy? It was really great.
Yeah, I loved it. Honestly, I did.
I thought it was really good.
No, it was really good.
I loved every minute, and then I look over and Larry's yawning.
He invited us to this movie.
I mean it's a biological function.
I thought it was rude.
Really rude.
You know who Cliff is? Cliff Cobb.
Cause I don't wanna make him feel bad.
Why should I say l'm going out?
You feel good that you're lying to him?
If I was playing checkers, l'd have told him I was playing checkers.
Why'd you tell the other guy that you're not playing golf?
I don't want to play with that guy anyway to tell you the truth.
I won't play golf with that guy.
He's out of his mind.
I know, he thinks he's doing a really good thing.
Trick or treat.
Happy Halloween.
Festive?
Hey, very nice, you're going golfing?
Yeah, actually.
This is a good look on you. I like it.
Thank you. I don't tuck in that much.
Golf makes me tuck in.
Any messages?
And Shelley Cobb called.
Hey, the bracelet might be ready.
Cheryl is gonna flip out when she gets this thing.
I wish I could videotape this reaction.
But I don't know how to work a video camera.
Okay, l'll get on that right now.
Shelley. Hi, it's Larry.
Yeah, a lot of fun.
And again, tell Cliff how much we enjoyed it.
That was really a good piece of work there.
Yeah. Okay.
We should go out. I'll talk to Cheryl.
No. That was just an arm.
I was just stretching my arm.
No, Shelley, of course not.
But no, that's not true.
But what about the bracelet? Shelley.
Larry? Is everything okay?
The Cobb salad was created at the legendary Brown Derby in Hollywood.
The owner, Bob Cobb, was hungry one night.
It wasn't the Drake Hotel in Chicago?
No, it was in Hollywood.
Let me see that.
My friend Cliff Cobb lied to me about the Cobb salad.
His grandfather didn't invent it.
Bob Cobb did.
There you go.
Bye.
Those kids are really cute.
Okay.
Well, let me just do a few more bags.
You do a few and then we'll switch.
Trick or treat.
You look more like 16 or maybe even 17.
I'm being my sister. This is my costume.
Wow, I would like to get my seat in your class.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Asshole. Fuck you.
Shit.
Can you believe this?
Those girls.
Because I didn't give them candy, that's why.
You're standing at the door with a bowl of candy.
They were just using Halloween to get candy.
Who cares?
It's Halloween, just give them candy.
I didn't know that it was gonna be felony or treat.
I didn't think the trick extended to felony.
Why would it kill you to just give them a few pieces of candy?
I don't understand that.
Because there's gotta be
And your shouldn't there be and should there be? Who cares?
Free candy, l'm 40 years old, l want free candy.
Not everybody knows your rules.
You have a long day of cleaning ahead of you.
I'm gonna clean it up by myself?
You're gonna clean this up by yourself.
Whose fault is this?
No they weren't subtle at all.
They were just going around from house to house for candy.
Is it possible to find these girls and maybe talk to their parents?
The Elvira thing.
No, that wasn't a costume.
I'm just using Elvira to describe her.
That's all.
They knocked on the door, they said, Trick or treat?
Yes.
I was giving out candy all night.
That's a hate crime.
We're a set, we're a group.
You can't call us bald assholes.
What if I were gay?
Would that be gay asshole?
That's a hate crime.
But it says bald asshole.
But we consider ourselves a group of people.
Sir, l'm bald, l'm not offended.
With all due respect, Officer Byrd, you are not bald.
You have chosen to shave your hair.
Did they threaten you in any way?
Did you see weapons of any kind?
No, there was no threat, except for the trick threat.
No treat? Trick.
It's a threat.
How far can you take these tricks?
But it's trick or treat.
We cut the kids a little slack on Halloween.
They say, Trick or treat, l would advise you, give the treat.
Why don't you give them the candy next time, Larry?
I will not be intimidated. Even on Halloween.
Are you playing golf?
Today? No, I played yesterday.
What are you doing dressed like that?
I like the outfit. I like the way it looks.
Doesn't have to be just golf.
You can't walk around? It's a shirt.
Wanna play tomorrow?
And why can't you?
Early in the morning, what does it matter?
Is she a baby?
How old is she, 5 or 6 years old?
Yeah, I don't have to chained to her the whole day.
I haven't seen the house yet, anyhow.
Great. We'll play. You're on for tomorrow.
What's going on?
I'm done with it. It's over.
He didn't wanna drive to your office and the whole thing's off?
I went to his office twice, he never came to mine.
It's too bad. It was a great idea.
I heard that Julia is looking for a project.
And if you ask me, you can do the exact same project with her.
She does have the exact same problem with Elaine.
People always see her as Elaine.
They just want her to do Elaine.
And I know she's been looking for a show.
I don't play golf. Look at that shirt.
I'm just wearing a shirt. I like this shirt.
Nobody wears a shirt like that unless they're gonna golf.
I like this shirt.
I get a lot of compliments on this outfit.
No, it's not the way it's gonna be.
I like the clothes.
You don't have to just wear them on the golf course.
You're sick.
Stop it.
Shelley?
Shelley's not here.
I need the bracelet that she made for me.
Yeah, the bracelet.
Yeah, yeah, your wife's birthday.
Forget the bracelet, Larry.
There isn't gonna be any bracelet.
No bracelet, I know what's going on.
You think I don't have eyes?
I'm not blind. Get it straight, all right?
My eyes work.
I'm talking about the little knee game with Shelley.
I'm talking about the arm over the neck.
She told me in the restaurant, you propositioned her.
I was joking around at the table, okay?
And she probably took me seriously.
She did take it seriously, l'm taking it seriously, too.
One friend jokes with the other friend.
Let me ask his wife to screw me.
That's how you joke around?
Wait a second.
What the hell are you wearing?
You expect me to believe that?
Yeah, they look good.
People compliment me.
I can see. You're a liar, man.
I'm just realizing this now.
That's true.
What's he gonna say?
I'll call you back.
Did you have a good time last night?
Yeah? I'd like to talk to your parents.
No, they're not.
Can I help you with anything?
I suspect they are.
Or you wouldn't be out here smoking.
Yeah, l'll bet you do.
Larry David.
What brings you to our Jewish home?
Well, well, now it all makes perfect sense.
Yes, this is my daughter.
Bullshit.
No, you're a liar.
Did you?
I heard about you trying to sleep around with her.
A disgrace to your people.
That's what you are.
Postman. Come here.
Tell the neighborhood.
What a shanda Larry David is.
He screws the wife of a man in a wheelchair.
A shanda.
Happy birthday.
Larry.
I'll meet you. Wait outside.
Happy birthday.
I forgot. We were supposed to play golf.
You can't play golf today.
We're supposed to be on the tee in 10 minutes.
Don't you knock before you come in?
I did knock. I've been knocking for a while.
Okay, quiet.
What's going on?
No.
I can't do it.
You know what I went through?
You have any idea what it takes for me to take a day off?
Do you have any idea?
What? Come on.
Maybe I can play nine. Hold on.
I can't do it.
Come on, just go.
No, don't eat cookies, it's almost time for dinner.
Why don't we go out?
We could stop and get a drink first.
What do you mean stop and have a drink first?
You know where I want to go?
Casa Del Mar, the fancy restaurant by the water.
We can stop and have a leisurely drink.
Are you kidding?
You can have a drink at the restaurant.
No, but this will be nice.
It'll be just a few hours of hanging out, having a drink.
It seems like you should just go and get the drink at the restaurant, no?
I would like to stop off and have a drink on the way.
It's the same drink, what's the difference where you have it?
It's a different atmosphere.
But it's the drink, isn't it?
They have it at the restaurant.
What's the difference what the atmosphere is?
You're missing the whole point of the drink.
That's it. What is the point of the drink?
I am missing the point.
Then why even go to the restaurant?
I don't wanna go.
Fine, we'll just get takeout food, great.
Rolling, rolling, rolling
All right.
Keep those doggies rolling
Rawhide.
Okay.
She's gonna love it, I bet.
This tennis elbow.
Yeah, you know what you should do, you should call Jojo.
This isn't our food.
Did you check the order before you left?
Yeah, I did, but I decided to take the wrong food home.
Thank you for inquiring.
What a pain in the ass.
That man just brought back your order.
Sir?
Okay, this is mine?
You're welcome.
My God.
You almost had my kung pao shrimp.
Wonderful, couldn't be better.
Good.
I'm back.
Good.
You know who I ran into? Allan Wasserman.
That's who had our food, Allan Wasserman.
Yeah, remember two years ago, l got out of that special.
I told him my stepfather got in an accident.
Yeah, why did you make up a lie about a stepfather?
Where's all the shrimp here?
Where's all the shrimp?
There's only three shrimp.
You can have them.
Did he take the shrimp?
I'll bet he took the shrimp.
He was probably hungry.
He got the container.
He knew, he saw it wasn't his food.
And he ate shrimp, and then brought it back.
What do you mean, Would he really?
There's three shrimp in there.
And then returns it?
What, thinking we're not gonna notice this?
The guy took our shrimp.
Good, nice move.
Hi, Lar. It's good to see you.
Maybe about 25 minutes, half hour.
Next time, l'll come to your office.
You don't have to come, l'm happy to come here.
No, we can go back and forth.
We don't need back and forth, we'll just do forth. Don't need back.
You've turned into a very nice man.
I'm a lovely gentleman. who was on a big TV show, a big hit show, like a Seinfeld.
Okay.
And she grows to hate the character, and she becomes embittered and hostile.
And she can't get work because of Evelyn.
The thing that I love about it is that, you know, this does happen to me.
And it happens to you, you're able to deal with this.
Elaine, Elaine, are you Elaine?
That happened to me last week, l was skiing.
Evelyn, Evelyn. lt'll be on the series.
Hey, Evelyn.
That's a good name for the series.
Aren't You Evelyn?
That's pretty good.
I mean, I think it's a really funny idea.
Yeah, that's true.
Really, this is all he can do, between you and me.
At HBO?
I want to be able to say fuck, you know.
What's the big deal about saying fuck?
Cocksucker.
You don't need to say that.
Actually, I do.
I haven't really gotten to say that a lot.
I haven't. I would like to be able to say that. Fuck.
Allan Wasserman.
What problem?
I think he's bad, l'm not gonna go into why.
Let me tell you why l'm bringing this up.
I've got a friend, a pretty good friend,
Michael Halbreich, who works there.
Gay, no, he's not gay, he's married.
That's great, I wish I was in a poker game.
Why don't you join?
A couple who's in the game, they're going to the Galapagos lslands.
You know, l'll ask Cheryl.
I mean, l'll play even if she doesn't want to.
I'd just like to put HBO in the mix, l'd really like to.
She has a very high tolerance for pain, this woman, don't worry about it.
Okay, do we have to talk about this right now?
The man's an artist.
My God.
What do you got? That's nothing.
That's gonna be a lot worse in two days.
Anybody have a cough drop?
I can't believe we're here.
I know, this is amazing.
The two of us, doing this together?
Lord, I don't like this at all.
Hang on a minute.
I like it a lot.
How long have you been her manager?
Is it four now?
Time flies when you're having fun.
Yeah.
Even when you're not.
Tell me what you think of this, okay?
What?
My wife and I are going out for Chinese food the other night.
She said that she wants to stop off for a drink first.
I don't get this.
It seems like a huge waste of time.
Yeah, it's lovely.
We're just going out to eat.
Was she mad?
Very annoyed.
We're not on good terms because of it.
I think you were totally right.
Yeah, see?
It makes no sense, unless you're trying to get laid.
And maybe that's what she was trying to do.
Maybe Cheryl wanted to get laid.
Okay, I got your point.
Listen, the two of you will take this.
You know, l'll introduce it, and you'll run with it, okay?
You ready?
There they are.
Hi, Michael, how are you?
I gave Melissa one of those, it's really nice.
Hi, Larry, it's Judy. It's nice to see you here.
It took about 45 minutes for that, didn't it?
You gotta make the nice.
We got a big show to pitch for you, big show. about this concept recently, and I think it's pretty exciting.
How were the garlic noodles, the other night?
But you did touch the shrimp.
What are you talking about?
Right, Al?
And when I got my order back from him, about seven or eight shrimp were missing.
No.
The shrimp mysteriously disappeared.
I don't want to talk about shrimp.
I would understand that you don't want to talk about it.
Look, Larry, you got your food, l got my food.
Yeah, you got your full order, l got mine minus seven shrimp.
You counted the shrimp,
It's pretty obvious when there's two shrimp.
If you want shrimp, take your $475 million, go buy a fucking shrimp boat.
He's gonna walk out now.
This is what he's famous for.
Nothing changes in 25 years with this guy.
Same shit.
What where you doing? What was that?
He implied that I was lying about my stepfather.
The implication for your imaginary stepfather?
As if I wasn't gonna know that he took the shrimp?
What does he think, l'm a moron?
Larry, everybody steals shrimp, and everybody lies about it.
This is Hollywood.
You got to apologize to this guy.
We want to make this here.
I want to make this here.
You have to get yourself into major psychoanalysis.
I'm in analysis, it doesn't do anything.
Apparently not.
Have you talked to him about your imaginary stepfather?
I'll tell you this right now.
Everyone ante up there. because I actually need a dentist, mine just moved.
You know, my dentist told me
I think it was about the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Everything's okay with you and Allan, right?
Larry, you guys are all made up and everything?
There was a mix up at a Chinese takeout restaurant.
Larry got Allan's order, and Allan, Larry's.
I guess when they switched them back,
Allan had taken seven of your shrimp?
I almost thought it was not real, but it was.
It was very impressive.
I'm in.
No, you're not out, sweetie, it's only two.
You wouldn't let him?
And I say, why keep supporting them?
It's ridiculous.
The game is Guts.
Card skill game, Brad.
No one appreciates Guts, what's the matter?
Let's play it. than the dental profession.
I'll bet you there's about $800 in there, you know that?
Let's try.
I don't even have enough to cover that.
Melissa, come on.
No, l'm out.
Hall, you must go in, she's gonna steal the whole thing.
I really can't do it, l've got nothing.
My God, look at that, holy cow.
You've got to tell us how much that is.
I can't believe you stole this pot.
What a bluff, l can't believe it. What did you have?
How could you not go in with an ace high?
You cunt, what a cunt.
I can't believe that you didn't go in with that.
What a hand, that's a great hand for this game.
How could you not go in with an ace high?
Come on, l'm kidding around.
On behalf of the women at this table, and myself, I am offended by that.
Please, we're playing poker here.
It's okay, l'm fine. It's fine.
It's not fine.
You know what, time to go, how about that?
Thanks for coming you guys, it was great to see you.
And he didn't act manly, he should've gone in.
He should've gone in with that ace.
Maybe in retrospect, l should've said, Pussy.
Maybe you are.
Maybe, l'm learning things about you.
Maybe I like to beat my wife a little bit.
Okay, l'll be good, I promise.
And Wasserman says this is our last chance. This is it.
Cause of what you said to Halbreich.
All of the women at HBO, they don't want to work with you.
Big deal, I call men pricks all the time, men want to work with me.
Cunt's worse.
It's not worse, pricks and cunts, they're equal.
What do you mean?
From you calling him a cunt, and he's examining everything in his life.
Taking a leave of absence.
There's no such thing as an effeminate heterosexual.
You're either gay or you're not gay.
He was gay, he's gay.
Hi, would you like to be seated?
How many shrimp do you generally put in the kung pao shrimp?
Eleven.
Thank you very much.
I don't think we ever had one like that.
This bruise, there's a funny story here.
And that applies to dentists, too?
I think so.
I think we're on the wrong page here.
Yeah, I have
Mickey, listen, this is a complete misunderstanding.
There's no misunderstanding.
What we saw
Dentist got in touch with Wasserman,
We'll go to ABC. I don't have to be at HBO.
What do they think people are watching?
Don't you? You don't go to the movies to see it.
Can I get this out of the way for you? Great.
How about dessert menu?
We got a lot of good stuff.
Relax by the beach.
But we're already here.
I don't know if that's any adventure, really.
You know what, fine.
You're breaking up the good time.
Cause I feel like l want a cup of coffee after I eat dinner.
You know, Larry, l would just like to go home.
Quick cup of decaf?
Can I get it to go?
That's different, though.
Actually, this is all a big misunderstanding.
Yeah, this.
You know, 'cause they're gray.
And gray is kind of right in the middle.
They look good.
We should get back to Cheryl.
You know, we just don't do enough things together.
She plays tennis, she won't play golf.
I can't play tennis because of my neck.
I don't really like the outdoors, you know.
It's not a good place for bald people out there.
The beach is lovely this time of year.
I go up to Santa Barbara, we go to the beach.
Very nice, it's not crowded.
She wouldn't know what to think, yeah.
All those disgusting bodies walking around, l have to look at them.
Our time is up.
Maybe l'll take her to the beach.
Okay, see you next week, be well.
Nice to see you. You cured?
It's such nonsense, isn't it?
What are you gonna do?
You can't bother your friends with this stuff.
Yeah, listen, I just want to say, l'm doing this charity thing.
You know what Groat's syndrome is?
Groat, have you ever heard of Groat's syndrome?
I mean, a lot of people are doing it.
No, you are the guy who created Seinfeld.
No one's gonna bid any money.
It's gonna be embarrassing.
To go to a Larry David lunch? 50 cents, you know, it's ridiculous.
No, you don't have to be entertaining.
You will? Great.
You'll be surprised at how much you go for.
Anyway, thanks, Larry, I really appreciate it.
That's great.
I think l'm gonna do it.
What do you think about going to the beach?
Santa Barbara.
Don't you think I would love to go to the beach?
What about golf, you're not playing golf?
I don't have to play. I won't play, big deal.
You don't have to play every Saturday.
Okay, you got a date.
Now, what do I need to bring?
I'll take care of the rest.
A radio? Is there a ballgame l can listen to or anything?
You bask in the sun.
Don't forget sun block.
I will not forget sun block.
Gotcha. I'm looking forward to it.
All right.
That was a nice drive, I have to say.
Yeah, look at this.
It's beautiful out here.
All right, let's see, l'll grab this.
Shoes in here.
Of course.
I thought l'd be uncomfortable.
You're going to the beach.
I didn't want to drive an hour and a half with a bathing suit on.
I don't have to put it on.
This is beautiful.
You want this water cooler?
I can't carry all this stuff.
Without Jews these sun block people would be out of business.
Is that right?
Yeah, l've never once seen a Gentile ask for, or even put on, sun block.
True.
I don't really get this fascination that people have with the ocean.
No?
I stare at it for 10 minutes and I go, Okay, I get it.
Don't you feel calmer?
I feel aggravated that l'm missing what other people are getting.
I think I just saw my therapist.
You see a guy in a striped bathing suit?
Skimpy, skimpy suit, you see that?
Why don't you go say hi?
How can he walk around in a bathing suit like that?
I mean, he's at the beach, he can wear whatever he wants, right?
Did you see the back of his bathing suit?
How does he walk around like that?
Can we go? Let's just go.
We just got here, we're not gonna go.
That's ridiculous. Plus, if you get up, don't you think he'll see you then?
I've got to stay like this now, for the rest of the day?
I guess that's up to you.
Kiss that therapist goodbye.
The only question now is, do I tell Richard Lewis?
No question about it.
It was Weiss, Dr. Weiss.
Thong, up his ass.
I turn you on to this guy, he's a brilliant doctor.
Saving you from this hedonist giving you advice.
Hedonist, he's a hedonist?
This is my 28th therapist since 1969.
I don't want to go anymore, l don't want to break the record.
The recap is very hard.
Your recap is two, three months, isn't it?
Two, three months? That's just the crib.
How am I gonna tell him l'm gonna leave now?
Is it like a woman?
Can you do it on the phone?
You're not canceling cable.
Let's go out to lunch, let's talk about this, cause we need a game plan.
There's no plan, you go in and quit.
What are you gonna do?
What is this, Roots?
What you mean, auctioned off?
He wants to have lunch with Larry David.
I feel a lot of pressure to be entertaining, you know?
All right, enjoy your lunch.
Mr David. Mr David, over here.
Like the president.
President Tyler.
Tippecanoe and Tyler, too.
You don't know?
I wasn't named after him, it's just a family name.
Yeah, five brothers and sisters, you know, lrish.
You ever catch your parents having sex?
You ever see Joe Piscopo's Jersey Guy?
I'm Jersey guy.
I'm from Jersey, l'm the Jersey guy.
Yeah, people from Jersey didn't really find that guy funny.
Ever play the salt and pepper shakers?
Happy Birthday To You.
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
We really appreciate it.
Please, whatever you need, l'll donate anything you want.
I'll donate it all. My time, my organs.
What do you want, you want a kidney?
I'll give it to you.
What else do you need?
I've got a terrific penis.
I could donate a penis.
I've got good spleen, excellent spleen.
Mr Spleen gets rid of dirt and grime
And grease in just a minute
Mr Spleen will clean your whole house
I've never heard of it. What is it called?
I know, 'cause he was a bald guy.
No, the doctor that initially diagnosed it was named Groat.
Dr. Groat might be Dick Groat's father, for all we know.
I'm not going back there.
No way, I can't, would you?
It's a couple minutes.
You don't mind, do you?
I just think it's kind of weird.
I'd be uncomfortable if you waited.
I'd feel it would be polite to wait for your food to arrive.
Yeah, but we're supposed to be having lunch together.
Do we have to start at the exact same time?
I don't get that.
I don't see why you can't wait two seconds for your cold sandwich. It's not even hot.
I don't see why you care if I take a bite of my food.
Thanks.
Thanks for switching appointments with me.
Yeah, no, problem.
Larry, what happened with that lunch?
What did you do?
Yeah, 'cause Lou Gehrig had a disease named after him.
And Dick Groat was a ball player.
I thought it was a possibility.
Didn't you read the literature I sent you?
You start eating before he gets his food?
I asked if he would mind. I was starving.
Meanwhile, the guy's insulted.
I said, Do you mind if I start?
He said, Yes.
Do you know anybody who would do that?
I said, ls there anything we can do to make it up to you?
Couldn't I just write the check?
Larry, that's not the point.
It's not just the giving money.
It's getting involved, you know, in Groat's.
It's being Groat's active.
These are all people, by the way, with Groat's syndrome.
I don't want you to lose the check.
They still trust me now, they would want me to do that?
Okay, all right. Good to talk to you.
All right, thanks a lot.
Hello.
Hello.
My whole life is in perspective.
I feel great.
You know what I am? I'm the terminator.
Which is even better, to go shopping with her. Imagine that.
But here's the thing that I want to say.
I would love to be able to come back.
You know, just intermittently, if I can, if you'll have me, I hope you will.
Yes, I don't need to come in regularly anymore.
You see how agitated you are, Larry?
I mean, that's a situation that I find rather annoying.
Yeah, but that's okay, that's okay.
I do feel great.
No, what you're seeing as agitation is actually ebullience.
Who am l? you're saying to yourself.
Yes, that's exactly what l'm saying.
Who are you?
I don't even want to talk about it too much, lest I dissipate it.
There's no swing. I'm a hammock.
Yeah, just gently flowing in the breeze, that's me.
You've been in therapy for a while, l know you pretty well.
Yeah, of course you are.
Because I know you were at the beach, Larry.
He knows about the whole thong thing.
He knows about the thong thing.
How did this happen? He's on to me now.
Who told him?
He must've told Rob, who told him.
I told him I was happy and I didn't need the therapy.
That's what l'm telling him.
How can you steal my termination?
I didn't. I didn't know you were gonna say that.
It's easy for you to say, l'm a shrink person.
Look, what is this? This is what?
Is this the Beverly Center, this thing?
Listen, it's good to see you.
Stay feeling good, I feel great too.
Battlestar Galactica?
It's a movie too, isn't it?
I've never felt better in my entire life.
Groat's, we're not as hyper as we seem
Groat's, let's hold on to the dream
Thank you.
Yes, that was Beth Sweeney, ladies and gentlemen.
Another round of applause for Beth Sweeney.
Wasn't she wonderful?
Your day is coming.
Don't give up hope, keep hope alive.
You must keep hope alive, bald people.
And she's a pianist.
And I think you're going to enjoy her very much.
This is awful. You can't let her do this.
Feeling all right?
No uncomfortable sensations?
Yeah. I think you'll be very happy with the treatment.
Really?
You actually think you're gonna fix my neck?
You have? l've been to a lot of different people.
Yeah, healers. What a joke that is.
Well, I understand your concerns.
Okay, l'll tell you what. l got a little proposition for you. lf you can fix my neck, l'll give you $5,000.
And if you can't, then I don't pay for any of the treatments.
Wait a minute now, if I cure you, how would I know if you are cured or not?
What are you saying?
That's ridiculous. lt's not in my family, but l'm trying to break the mold.
All right, done. l hope you win.
Larry?
How you doing?
You don't have to look at me that way, no need for pity.
No, I mean, l'm just shocked to see you here working.
What do you want?
All right.
Do you ever hear from any of those guys at Saturday Night Live?
The writing wasn't happening?
You know, l just couldn't write for TV anymore.
But things are going good, except for this thing with my dad, a situation.
He came to your house, yeah, I remember.
And he had a triple bypass, a quadruple bypass.
Boy, he's got seven total bases there, yeah.
And he's left me the money in his will.
But he won't let me have any of it, you know?
Not a penny, until, like, he's actually dead.
Your father's got a lot of money, doesn't he?
And won't give you the money until he dies?
Why do people do that? l don't know why you have to wait until he dies. That's crazy.
Are you guys out of peanut butter here?
Because I can't find it.
Yeah, when do you expect that'll be?
Okay, tell me if I got this right.
And $5,000 to that asshole, Barry Weiner?
Yeah, that's not quite accurate. l haven't paid the acupuncturist yet.
He has to cure my neck.
And l'll be happy to give it to him if he does.
People come to you with their hands out, you can't say no? l have trouble saying no.
You know why?
Cause you're a pussy. l'm just being frank.
Maybe l'm nice.
Maybe l'm just nice.
Hey there, flowers for Larry David.
Are those from your mistress and you haven't told me?
Did you give him a $5,000 tip?
This is really bizarre.
Flowers.
They're pretty. 'Enjoy these beautiful orchids. Kazu.'
Did you even know, did you know he was working there? l didn't know he was working in the deli.
He keeps in contact with me.
He doesn't let me know that stuff.
Boy. 'There, but for the grace of God, go you.'
Yeah, go me.
Would you? I don't know?
Would you go back? l mean, that's a weird thing. l wouldn't go back.
Let me ask you a question. ls it common in Japan for a man to send another man orchids?
A professional man?
Have you worked it out that way?
Cheryl will love me.
You know, you're encroaching in my territory. l want you people to be uncomfortable all the time. lf you don't like this, you should come by on Naked Tuesdays.
Yeah, Naked Tuesdays.
See? He's a funny lawyer. l'll see you Tuesday.
Five to 10 years.
That's the direction we're heading. lt's gonna be a sad state of affairs.
People like you walking around like people like me.
Why are we even riding with him anyway? l don't know, he asked me if he could pick us up.
And you couldn't say no.
Listen, I think we should just go without him.
Larry.
What are you doing?
Room service was late with my food.
What do you want?
No.
You're not wearing jeans to this party.
And a blue sweatshirt and a black jacket, no.
Since when is blue and black no good?
Trust me on this one, please.
You're gonna have to change. And quickly. to put on, asshole.
My God, I don't know who to hug.
Why don't you go?
You know, you two go in, we'll wait here.
What is that? lt's my birthday.
You're having a surprise party?
What, you didn't invite us?
Surprise.
Yeah, great, thanks.
Happy?
You knew? What happened?
Sit down, have a big fucking meal in the hotel.
Do you believe them?
Do you believe what they did to me? l mean, 600,000 people. 600,000 people died in the Civil War.
And for what, to save the Union?
Why did we want to save the Union?
Who cares? l don't know, I don't care.
What is important about saving the Union?
NRDC? What the hell is that?
She didn't like my outfit.
They got to approve your outfit. l listened to her.
That's one of the reasons that, you know, we were late.
Let's see. lt might stand for ''certified deposit'.
You want to have lunch?
Stop it, Mr Weiner.
You know what I mean. l think I do know what you mean. l mean it very sincerely.
Good to see you.
Please excuse me to the ladies' room.
Larry, why don't you have a seat here?
Now, how the hell would I know what that means? l don't know what they do in Japan.
They might take it up the ass for all I know in Japan.
What are you asking me for? lt's a stupid question.
Actually, a new show
You got to be kidding me.
What show? Seinfeld? l did okay.
When he'd come over to my house, he could sit and relax.
Why should he wait until he's dead to give me the money? lt's ridiculous.
Do you know of an estate lawyer?
My lawyer's in Acapulco. l need an estate lawyer right away.
Yeah, I know a great estate lawyer.
Joel Reynolds. l ran into him the other day.
Reynolds and McKay, he's great.
Thank you for the lawyer.
And I love your wife.
What kind of change?
What are you talking about?
You'll find out. l don't know, Cheryl.
Maybe he'll make a contribution.
Where are you meeting for lunch?
That's the Japanese restaurant. l was there with Jeff last week.
Barry Weiner's here.
All right, listen, get as much money as you can from him.
Be charming. Okay, goodbye.
What did you do? What the hell did you do?
Your little conspiracy with Cheryl worked.
He cut me out of the will, Larry.
Just like you and Cheryl planned, your little conspiracy.
But why?
He's down there right now, Larry.
He is down there flushing my fucking life down the toilet.
That's what he's doing now, thanks to your help.
Hello, sir, Joel Reynolds. l'm a little puzzled.
What's this outfit? ls it a Halloween party, or what?
That means we just dress like we would at home. l know, you told me that already.
What do you do on Casual Friday?
We just come in, do our work.
But we dress casually. l don't give a damn if it's half a day a week. l don't like it. l'm here to change my will.
A lot of money is involved.
Then why the hell you dress that way? l want you to be on cutting edge whenever you're handling my business.
You gotta talk to him and tell him I didn't put you up to that.
You have to convince him. l'm totally screwed.
Wait, hold on.
This is Kathleen calling from Dr. Muriyama's office.
I'm calling to confirm your acupuncture appointment.
No, I can't do it.
Okay, the doctor just wants to know how you're feeling.
Would you like to schedule another session?
Okay.
You got to get down there.
He's supposed to have lunch with my wife at this Japanese restaurant later.
You're the only one that can fix it, you know? l was just trying to be helpful.
Mr Weiner, I don't think l should have anymore sake.
Because it's a wonderful preface to a great Japanese meal.
First, a little slice.
Everybody, this is Larry David.
We used to write together on Saturday Night Live.
A long time ago.
And this is Jeff Greene.
Larry, you remember my cousin, Doug, from the party, Thursday?
That's a sad story. Excuse me.
Larry.
There it is. I told you. Don't cash it for week.
That's just great, Larry, you got your money back.
What check? What are you talking about?
Larry lent Barry $5,000.
You're a bounty hunter.
Why did you have to throw the water at him?
You're not going anywhere.
You killed my uncle, you murderer.
Let go of him.
How do you like that? Good for you.
Say, would you like to make another deal on that one?
What do you mean, another one?
You already owe me $5,000 for the other one.
Would you like a chance to get it back, maybe?
How do I owe you $5,000? l don't owe you $5,000.
What are you talking about?
My receptionist called you and talked to you on the phone.
Yeah, she asked me how I was feeling. l said, ''Better.'
There's a confusion here, a language confusion.
Better is not all better, it's better.
Everyone knows about this agreement.
My employees, my business.
We made an agreement as men of honor.
Send them orchids?
They want her to bring Evelyn back.
She can't get away from it. ln fact the series could be called
Aren't you Evelyn?
What's with you and the water?
Constantly running to the bathroom.
The other thing is that
Alexander, you're kidding me? lt's about a motivational speaker.
We've had a few meetings and we're very close to having it happen.
Where did you meet, if I may ask?
About 4 meetings now.
Such a wonderful actor.
Yeah, nothing like him.
He's the greatest guy.
We split up. l'm living in a hotel.
Part 1 is tonight, part 2 is tomorrow night. lt's just beautifully shot.
Love you to come.
All right, good. We'll see you there.
What's the difference between
Did you pencil that in and didn't tell me? l think it's about to start.
All right, bye. l'll talk to you later.
Yeah, he's hard to miss.
Listen, we're gonna see you tonight at the house, right? l'm exhausted.
He must have a lot on his mind tonight.
Really? I got a condition. l really need to have this.
Yeah, I think it is.
What's the deal? What is she doing?
Does she work here, or is she a guest?
Excuse me.
How come you told me to get rid of the water then? l saw you coming in with water.
There's no water, that's the rules. l don't see how it was your concern.
You don't work here. lt's the rules. The sign says, 'No food or drink in the theater.' l'm sure we would all like to have water.
We're all dying of thirst.
What are you, the hallway monitor here? l don't think the golden rule applies here. lf you had water, would you want me to tell you not to bring it in?
How about common courtesy?
But that doesn't supersede the golden rule.
That's the big one.
You're nuts.
Jackass. 'Now, don't bring any pens or pencils in.'
Now, is she a guest?
Does she work there?
We had this huge fight.
There she is, right there, on the right.
She's talking to Anne Michaelson,
You've gotta go to part two.
You're part of the ABC family.
We're definitely going to part two.
Yeah, we're not going to dinner with you, though.
We don't have plans, we don't wanna go to dinner with you. l actually wanna go 'cause she showed a lot of cleavage for that time.
Stop it.
No, your tongue to the roof of your mouth.
No, I haven't met Larry, but l've heard a lot about you.
Yeah, just to the right.
Yeah, I do have to go potty.
What are you doing? l'm just brushing my doll's hair.
Yeah? What's her name?
Judy. 'Judy. Judy. Judy.'
Boy, she's got pretty long hair.
Do you think maybe it's too long? lt's kind of long.
Yeah, do you think you could give it a haircut?
You want me to give it a haircut? lt's called a Swiss Army Knife.
You heard of Switzerland? lt's a country in Europe, and they don't like to fight.
About right there.
You wanna give it a little, kind of, Dorothy Hamill thing?
Yeah.
Boy, she's got really thick hair.
At least it'll be shorter.
Yeah, now this is definitely easier to brush, and it looks great.
Thank you.
That's your top priority in a house. 2 minutes. l didn't cut it. He did.
Yeah, she asked me.
She asked me to give it a haircut.
You walked into my daughter's room and cut her Judy's hair?
And did you happen to tell her that maybe it wouldn't grow back?
And this little girl doesn't know that her dolly's hair won't grow back.
She is a collector's item.
We can't find another one like this.
You can replace it?
This is like Liberty, the Beanie Baby.
Out Of Production, OOP, okay?
Not coming back. l guess I missed a strand there. lt's ugly, mommy.
Let me get it. I got a Swiss Army Knife. l could get that.
She said it looked good earlier. She liked it.
Go ahead.
Jesus Christ.
My daughter has a huge doll collection.
Her room is filled with dolls. l think she might have that Judy doll.
We can go in tomorrow, zip in, zip out, boom.
She won't notice.
Hasn't played with it in a long time.
We'll go by the house tomorrow, we'll check it out.
Yeah, I mean, otherwise, you know, this is ugly here.
The whole ABC deal could go down the drain. lt really could.
Yeah.
He knows a lot about me.
What did he see exactly?
Everything, exactly.
Are you out of your mind?
HBO, you know what happened with them. lt's all running out.
That's your fault. l got news for you.
Why?
Because if I don't replace the doll, it's over.
You don't think Sammy's gonna mind?
She's not gonna notice?
She's got a million dolls.
She's won't notice anything.
You have no idea how much money l've spent on dolls.
This?
She looks Swiss.
She looks like Judy.
She looks Swiss? All right.
What's up here? Any stuff up here?
There's dolls up here?
There you go.
No, it's not her. l said it in my head. and she has brown eyes. lt's brown eyes.
Holy shit.
A bunch of bald ones up here.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You're supposed to call first.
You need a drill.
What is going on here?
What are you doing here?
Listen, and l'll tell you.
Sammy's shelf has been on my mind. l've always thought this shelf was loose.
And I came here, and I pushed it and tested it. l don't know.
What are you doing here in Sammy's room, of all places?
And you brought Larry to help you with the shelf? l know a lot about shelving.
Mr California Closets over here all of a sudden?
Fat fuck, trying to hide, like you're Mr lnconspicuous. l might be.
What do you think?
Do you think it's gonna work? l hope it works. lt was painful.
She's not gonna have any problem with this?
She's got the body. You're fine.
Yeah, good, that's fine.
Boy, that's starting to itch me down there.
What's wrong, Sammy, darling?
Yeah?
Judy, I got Judy.
Where's her body? lt didn't come with a body.
All right. Why don't you come in? l'll take it upstairs and make sure it fits.
Don't worry, it's gonna fit.
We'll just see about that.
Right here, in the hall.
Beautiful, excellent.
You think this is gonna be okay?
Do you think she's gonna notice the difference?
She's already at Merman.
She is gifted, she's highly gifted.
We might not be able to pull it off.
Yeah, it's a shame she didn't know that the hair wasn't gonna grow back, yeah. l mean, 'cause she's a bright girl.
You'll be at part 2?
You know, I actually think she looked pretty good with the short hair.
God.
Where's the head? l know you took the doll's head. Where is it?
Where's the fucking head? l don't know.
Stop scratching your balls and tell me where it is.
Just get me the fucking head, all right?
Both of you, 'cause l've had it,
No, I guess not. back to Susie and your daughter?
They won't know the difference.
Your daughter's won't know that the hair was cut?
My daughter andlor Susie are not gonna know the difference.
You've got an allergic reaction, l'm telling you.
That's gonna be a lot of fun. 'Where did you get the rash?' 'l stuck a doll's head down my pants, Doctor. 'lt feels good to me.'
Yeah.
Why would you want l just like it, you know.
Okay, you know what? I don't know. l'll go and see if it's there.
Thank you, l'd appreciate it.
Great.
Yeah, fine. Good.
Okay.
You are not gonna believe what I just saw. lt's your daughter, too, you know.
That's the head.
This is not the head.
Yeah. l'll see you later. ls your assistant going out with anybody?
You're not going out with my assistant, okay?
How do you know I wanna go out with her? l know what you're talking about. l'm not an idiot.
There are the Davids.
Honestly, I can't even look at that guy now. lt makes me sick to my stomach.
You know what? l'll be right back. l'm going to the bathroom.
Do me a favor.
See if anybody is in the ladies' room?
Why? lt's an olfactory nightmare in that men's room. ls anybody in here? 2 minutes, okay.
Spencer is too adorable. Totally adorable.
Jill, how old is he now?
You have them and it's instant.
Where's the bottom of the broccoli?
You know, look at this broccoli, there's nothing.
What is it?
Who put this on earth, this vegetable?
You want to switch glasses with me, is that it? l like that whole Clark Kent thing you got happening there.
Yeah, l'm real excited.
Don't get me wrong.
You know, I don't really know that much about art.
But you know about Jeremy.
That's the point, right?
And his work, right?
That seems easy enough.
And to the fellowship that's gonna be, all right?
You're not a Lakers fan are you?
You're a Knicks fan.
But l'm going tomorrow night.
Right, when they lose, which is very seldom.
Very seldom. I mean, they have Shaq.
Best player that ever lived. End of story. l had I just need to seize this moment while Bob's in the bathroom.
Make it funny, would be great, if you could make it funny. l mean, I have a limited amount of time. l've got his letter to write.
You know, Bob's thing doesn't have to be a big thing.
Really? Good, thank you.
Thank you, that'll be great.
What?
My parents came into town, and I hate to leave them by themselves.
Thanks for coming out. l go out to dinner, I wind up with a homework assignment.
What was all that goodbye business?
Never in my life have I forgotten.
Yes, you have. Then people think that you're doing it intentionally.
That's ridiculous.
You know how much I paid for that dinner? l just kept putting money down.
We already settled that.
What are you guys playing, Scattergories?
Hope you don't mind, we raided your games.
And your liquor.
You wanna play a quick round of Scattergories?
Larry, don't you say goodnight?
Goodnight.
For heaven's sake.
Give me time, I want to do it, too.
Occidental.
Do you know anything about these pages?
What do you know?
She's very vague about the whole thing.
What are you supposed to write on it?
Maybe l'll make little fancy edges on the end.
Don't they have, like, special scissors to make those fancy edges on the end?
By the way, I could make those triangles and those circles.
Okay. 'l'll find out his last name and write back to you.'
No. lt's stupid.
Who are you going to dinner with?
Listen, I can't go to the Laker game tonight. cause her mom's sick, and I gotta watch the kid.
Who's getting the ticket?
Why don't you give it to Lewis?
Good to see you, how are you?
Good, Albert Mayo, Larry David,
Larry David, Albert Mayo.
Nice to meet you. l'm going to the game tonight.
You're the Seinfeld guy, right? l gotta run, I gotta get to the Center.
Enjoy the game, have a good time.
Just look at this thing on my back. l don't know what that is.
You know, you ought to go to a doctor.
You know that guy right over there?
That's Dr. Wiggins, that's who he was talking about.
You can make an appointment and just come to the office.
All he had to do was take a look at it.
Would it have killed him?
He's in the locker room.
All he's gotta do is take one quick look, take five seconds.
How you doing?
Man, I mean, the guy's trying to relax like you.
You gotta give the guy space.
Come on, enjoy the game.
This is, you know, we have a great manager.
What can I tell you?
Ladies and gentlemen, your Los Angeles Lakers.
You've got the best seat in the house, you know that?
You do.
The bench is right over here, look at this.
Shaquille O'Neal.
Anthony Peeler, two shots.
What's he doing?
Why doesn't he put Shaq back in the game?
Yeah, l'll ask him, with his eight rings, that Larry David's upset.
He's been out of the game for five minutes.
Maybe he's upset.
Maybe, you know, he's tired.
My God. ldiot, what did you do?
Take it easy. Where is it?
Let's get him up, l'll hold the leg, get him up. Get him up.
No. lt was an accident.
This is a nightmare. l think we should get going. l'm very uncomfortable.
Just go.
Go. Get out of here, go ahead, hurry up. lt was an accident.
Yeah, no, believe me, Julie, I saw it. l saw him on the news. l saw the whole thing, and he just walked in. l can't talk right now. l'll talk to you later. Okay.
They said you tripped Shaquille O'Neal, now he'll be out for two months.
You mean I tripped him?
They said Larry David?
They have it in slow motion.
They have, 'Larry David took out Shaquille O'Neal.'
For two months he's gonna be out.
And the phone will not stop ringing.
Look, can we call you back tomorrow?
He's gonna be out two months?
Yeah, I did have a motive. l wanted to kill him, I had a motive.
Can you take it outside, please?
How about a little consideration, okay?
My parents are trying to watch their show.
Don't you say goodnight?
Asshole.
Yeah, you, it's all your fault.
Yeah, asshole.
What the fuck? lt was an accident. l was just stretching my legs out and he tripped.
They took away my tickets.
The Lakers took away my tickets.
Sure they can, it's on the back of the ticket. l'm responsible for whoever sits in my seat.
What were you stretching for?
Holy shit, you know how hard I worked for those?
Have a great day.
Yeah, I know. But, I mean, without Shaq, we can't win this, you know?
How much more clear can I be?
No comment.
All right, thank you.
All the Seinfeld shows, every one.
Have you ever done a page in a birthday book?
Yeah, all the magazine shows are calling.
They're gonna do a spread.
Don't leave that in the middle. l gotta put this in here.
Put it wherever you want to put it. lt's fine with me.
Holy mackerel.
Dad, don't you want to stay a little bit longer?
All right, I mean, if you reconsider, you can come back.
Don't you say goodbye?
Wow. Boy.
Really, that's wonderful.
How did the other acquaintances take it, okay?
They were just fine with it, you know? Thanks. canceled the page in the birthday book.
No.
Adora, if anybody wants me, l'm going to Starbucks. l'll take a mocha.
One of the vanilla bullshit things.
You know, do whatever you want.
Whatever you got, I don't care.
You got it.
What? What's the problem?
Just too enthusiastic, and I miss the old Larry.
Larry, l'm glad I caught up to you.
Housekeeper said you'd be down here. l want to talk to you real quick.
You don't want me to write the letter of recommendation.
You take care of yourself.
Anything you want.
On me, I got it, everybody, come on.
That's right, go ahead, enjoy yourself.
Thataway, that's it, don't be shy.
Thank you very much, thank you.
Come on, people, everything on me.
This is very good, by the way, thank you. lt's a cafe latte? What is that, milk?
Milk and coffee, who would've thought?
We've gotta go there, sit down, have a donut, have a bagel.
Thank you very much, thank you.
Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender.
Excuse me, are you a doctor?
Would you mind taking a quick glance at this thing on my back?
Tell me if it's anything that I should be concerned about.
More doctors should be like you.
Excuse me. l've got these tapes l'd like to give to Shaquille O'Neal. ls that possible?
Just leave them there.
We'll make sure he gets them. l just was gonna give these
Seinfeld tapes to Shaq.
That's really nice of you.
Nice of you to come down here to apologize. l'll take you in there with me, come on. l'm sure he'd appreciate an apology.
What can you do? Things happen.
That's a great present.
He'll be on his back for two months.
Dairy product, peanut butter.
What you mean, no?
The whole world knows peanut butter is a dairy product.
Larry David, Shaquille O'Neal.
Albert told me you were a big fan.
You have every tape of every show?
Yeah.
He was obviously making it up after the time ran out.
What do you mean? You gave us five names.
There's only three here.
Listen, Doc, you know what? l'm sick and tired of you.
Get this guy out of here, you're fired.
You gotta go.
Don't you say goodbye?
Notice how no one ever says goodbye anymore?
Why can't people leave a room and be a little polite?
Okay, my favorite Seinfeld episode was The Contest.
Peanut butter is a dairy product.
I was alone.
Good morning.
No.
Larry, no.
You know what? l think it's time to get rid of it.
What're you talking about?
What's the matter with it?
Everything. Look at it, it's maroon.
What? Get the hell out of here.
This will be quick and painless.
There you go.
They make the best husbands.
And he's converting.
He's getting baptized and the whole thing, whatever.
God, I hate doing this, 'cause, you know, you always take it the wrong way.
You take everything the wrong way, ever since l've known you.
Seven years ago,
Forget Paris.
All right, you stole my outgoing message on my answering machine.
What, are you crazy? What, are you nuts? l know you're ethical, l'm ethical.
You know, when people steal jokes, we fucking hate that.
But I hate when people fucking steal my outgoing messages.
You don't even know what you're talking about.
You wrote it in Paris? l had that message seven years ago. l wrote it seven and a half years ago.
Whose word are you gonna trust, okay?
My parents are dead. You have a family.
He doesn't have a wife, and his parents are dead.
That's right. I hold onto these things, man.
Doesn't have a wife, and his parents are dead.
Do me a favor and change it for me.
And they would've been 95, but they're dead.
Are you done?
Yeah, l'm done. l didn't steal your message, asshole. l didn't take it.
You took it from me, but you know what? l'll be the man.
Whatever.
Ridiculous.
Hi, we're not in. Please leave a message at the tone. Thank you.
Fantastic.
How's that an admission of guilt? l was the man. l'm a big man. l'm a big, expansive man.
You're a small, petty man.
Don't change that. l remember when you made that message. l thought it was very funny.
What do I got to take?
Do I need a traveling outfit?
You're gonna witness the whole thing.
What does the average gentile wear to a baptism?
Khakis and a blue blazer would be wonderful.
Boy, this is rough.
This guy's converting.
Why is he doing that?
You guys come to our side, we don't go to your side.
Yeah. Jews don't convert. l'm really surprised.
She's very passionate about her religion.
Do I go around pushing lobster on people?
Do I say, 'You must like lobsters, eat lobster. 'lt's good, it's good''?
You know, it's not only where you live.
Lobster and religion, l really don't see the similarities.
What time is the car picking us up in the morning? l'm gonna drive.
They never show up, they're not dependable.
Then we have to find a parking space when we get to the airport.
We'll leave early, that's okay.
Come on, honey, let's get going. l can't find the tickets.
When was the last time you had them?
My office. l left them in the office.
Shit.
That's okay, we got time. lt's all right, we have time.
We got up early enough.
They're not there.
And I know where they are.
Why not? Monterey's a beautiful place.
Was anything else stolen?
Was anything else gone? l don't know, I wasn't paying attention.
He's not gonna break into our house, he's going to Monterey.
This is ridiculous. l'll call the airline and tell them what happened.
He can't get on the plane with our tickets, can he?
Why can't he? lt's a ticket.
He hands them the ticket, he walks on the plane. Call the airline.
No, I don't think it works like that. l don't know.
All right, just tell them what's going on.
Okay. Hi. Yes, AirWest?
Thank you.
They're connecting.
Well? What? l'm still on hold, Larry.
How are we doing on time? l don't know. We'll make it, I think.
Hi, yes.
They just put me on hold.
They're gonna get a supervisor.
Look at this.
Should I go to Lincoln?
There's the lot.
Hi.
No, because l've already spoken to you.
You know what? Just forget it.
We're already here at the airport.
There's no spaces.
Larry, we've been down this aisle.
What's this guy doing?
Yeah.
Excuse me, you leaving?
Yeah, he's leaving.
Maybe he's already in our seat. l wonder if he brought a date.
Yeah, it's all right, take your time.
Nobody's waiting for you.
Make a call, have a cup of coffee.
And then have a nice bagel.
Take a little nap.
That's fine.
What are you doing in there?
Trade places, you can do it over here. l'm trying to get catch a plane, sir.
Get here earlier. lt's not my fault.
Good, okay.
Yeah.
What? lf the lot's full, why do they even let you go in?
They shouldn't even give you a ticket.
Gotta drive around like an idiot for 15 minutes?
God, look at that line.
We'll have to go to the front and tell her.
We'll just explain the situation.
We don't have time, Larry, come on.
We've lost our tickets. l'd be happy to help you if you step to the back of the line.
We really don't have time. l understand that, but you need to get to the back of the line, please.
Everybody here has been waiting, okay? l will take care of you when it's your turn, okay? Thank you. ls the plane filled up?
All right, where were we?
You're all set. l got the guy. That's the guy.
Okay, you can give me the ticket.
What l'm talking about? l'm talking about the ticket you took from my office.
You memorized the building code, entered the office. l want the ticket. I gotta get on the plane. l don't have your ticket.
Of course you do. lt's a bereavement thing, my mother's death.
Right, okay, yeah. l'd like to take a look at it, okay?
Yeah, I do.
You wanna see? Let's take a look, all right? ls it your name? No, it's mine. 'Chris Darga.'
See, if this were yours, it would say ''Fucking Douchebag.'
Ladies and gentlemen,
What are you talking about?
The ticket right here, to Monterey.
Give me the ticket back, l don't have your ticket.
What are you talking about?
Come on, the ticket.
Go fuck yourself.
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Did you look at these people?
Did you see anything? l don't know who you're looking for, Larry.
Final boarding call for flight 1459, nonstop to Monterey.
Will all remaining passengers please board?
Hi. We lost our tickets.
We already have tickets.
Actually, the door is closed.
That would not be good, actually.
You can rent a car to Monterey. lt's about 100 miles. and that should work for you.
Then we wouldn't miss the baptism. l'll set that up for you. l need a credit card and l'll get this all rolling for you.
Larry, give her your credit card. l wanna call Richard Lewis. l want you to corroborate this message.
That is such a funny message.
She'll talk to you in person.
She wants to discuss this in person.
Okay.
Thank you.
All passengers in rows 16 and higher may board now.
Okay. l'm gonna drive. Thank you.
Jesus Christ, slow down. l'm gonna check the machine.
Have you ever had a fresh grape? l've had fresh apples, never had a fresh grape. l've never had a fresh cherry, never had a fresh pear.
Never seen a pear.
Never saw a pear outside of a fruit stand.
What's going on?
The machine's not even coming on.
There's no message.
The message that you changed from your office?
This is nice country, don't you think?
Nice country up here.
Maybe we should move up here.
Think we should? l think you should look at the map and find out where we are exactly.
Settle down?
Are we settled down, do you think? l mean, what do you have to be to be settled down?
We have a house, and chairs.
They gotta ruin everything.
They ruined the continental United States.
Yeah, we have a beautiful Pacific coast,
You don't need more states.
We're not the British empire.
What, are they trying to turn us into the British empire? right there.
Yeah. if we miss this. This is a row of pines.
We already passed pines.
Let's just stop and get out and take a look.
Stop.
No, Larry.
What's going on? No. My God. Honey, kick.
Jesus, get him. He can't swim.
God.
Hold on.
How you doing?
Anybody need a change of dry clothes? ls this what you had in mind?
You like this, you dick?
Honey, it's fine. lt's not fine.
Bullshit, you didn't think he was drowning, you didn't want him to convert.
That is ridiculous.
You didn't want to lose a Jew. l don't care if I lose Jews.
Take them all, I don't need them.
That was the point of the baptism, but you came and blew it.
Tell her it was an accident, you didn't mean to interrupt. l never saw a baptism before, l don't know what it is. l've never been to a bris, but I know what it is.
He didn't mean to interrupt you.
Larry, can I have a word with you for a second?
Come here. You don't know me, Dave Levin.
You don't have to take a bow for it, l'm just telling you.
As one Jew to another, it's a gutsy thing to come in and step in.
Don't be modest about this.
You're with us now.
You're with us now, all right?
The question is, what do we do now?
When do we go back in? l got under the water, you held me under.
No, you just kind of started it, but it didn't really work.
Not complete.
That's not my fault, l did what I was supposed to do.
But you gotta go back in. l dunked you one time, you need to be dunked three times.
You need two more dunks.
You're joking, right? l don't want anymore dunking.
Get back in, a couple of dunks, you're done. l don't wanna go back in there. lt was hard enough the first time. l like the way you told them you've never seen a baptism before.
You're a genius.
You did it. You done did it, boy.
We don't have to do it in a river.
We're not getting married.
This man happened to do a wonderful thing today. that being a Christian isn't a wonderful thing? lt's wonderful for you, we resent the recruitment.
We don't need you.
Everything's a big problem with you people. lt's good to be home.
There's my jacket, there's the guy you gave my jacket to.
Can you help me out?
No, I know, Jeff, I know it's a great idea.
That's not what the issue is.
The problem, quite honestly, has been you, Larry.
Yeah. l mean, it's just been a fiasco from start to finish. lt just seems that trouble seems to be following you.
Where would we even go?
What are our choices here, CBS?
He's gonna do it all from now on.
He will do it all.
At the next meeting, you don't even have to say a word.
You don't even have to come and l'll sell it.
Just divorce yourself from the whole thing until there's a script in front of you, okay?
They needed reassurance, I think, right?
They needed reassurance, that's completely what it was. l just read about that in the paper.
You know that guy?
He works at the restaurant, Moho, in your hotel.
The W Hotel.
Why didn't you say hello to him? You know him.
Where do you come up with these things?
He wanted to stop and chat with me and I don't know him that well. 'Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you. Take care, bye.'
No, it's more than that.
That was kind of rude.
That was not rude.
You always have rules
Guess who l'm going to see.
Kim nails or Kim psychic?
Last time, she was dead on.
She's great. Yeah.
That's amazing, she's almost magical.
Only you could have a bad time in Hawaii.
Yeah, anybody could've predicted that.
You know what I like about her?
Stuff that's bad, she doesn't hold back.
She'll tell you. Yeah.
Cause a lot of psychics, they hold back on the bad stuff.
Who's gonna pay to hear a bunch of bad shit?
Nobody want to hear that.
Do you believe this?
What the hell are they doing?
Putt it.
They walk around.
Are they playing for thousands of dollars?
Come on.
They can't feel your tension, okay?
You're just all wired up.
You know what? I got a masseuse.
This weekend you're gonna see her, my treat.
You're just all tense.
You need to relax, cause golf doesn't relax you.
How can you relax if these guys take a year like this?
No problem, don't worry about it.
Finally, they're done. l can't hit in front of an audience.
You know, I just can't.
Yeah, let's try to breathe through it, okay, together?
And do you think this might relate to anything that may have happened to you?
Yeah.
And have you ever talked to her about this, maybe?
Yeah, l've mentioned it to her a couple of times.
The whole body does better when there's no blockages anywhere.
How are you feeling?
Would you like me to finish you off?
Okay.
Hot.
Stop.
Stop.
Good to see you.
What's going on?
What in the God's name is wrong with you?
And I go, ''Okay.' l don't know what the hell she's talking about. l think she'll work more on my neck and that'll be it.
Wait a minute, are you messing around with me?
No, I didn't know what she was talking about. ls this a gag?
That's why l'm not throwing it back your way.
How did you do that?
And if your wife ever finds out, you're a noble man, you made it stop.
She's not gonna find out, don't worry about it.
Yeah.
The psychic told his wife he would hit a hole in one, and he did.
You better stop her from going.
Don't forget the CBS meeting.
CBS today, yeah, l'll see you there.
Don't be late.
Good. Guess what? l have made plans for us tonight.
Listen, I have a limo that's gonna pick us up. lt's gonna take us to Moho for dinner at the W Hotel.
Why didn't you stop? lt's too awkward and horrible
Don't worry about it. l wouldn't worry about it. lt's not a done deal or anything.
Come on, it's as good as done, right?
Have you seen my keys? l have an appointment with the psychic. l'm actually running late. I got them.
Right now? Listen, I have an appointment.
Forget the psychic. Let's fool around. lt took me a long time to get this.
No, not right now.
No means no.
God, no, save it for tonight.
Larry, no. Listen, I have got to get going. l'm afraid she's gonna tell you about it.
Do you hear what l'm saying? l'm dying.
Aren't you Evelyn? l like the edge of it because it's funny, but it's a little quirky, too.
This is all Larry's idea.
And, Lar, hello?
Hello? We're pitching.
He getting more than just a massage.
He's very happy.
Yeah, he having sex with her hand.
Situations like that are gonna come up on the show.
Great, terrific, fantastic.
We'll be in touch.
Aren't you gonna ask me how my appointment went?
Right, the psychic. How did it go? l know everything, Larry. l know what happened.
What happened?
What do you mean, ''What happened''?
What happened, what happened?
That you're having an affair. l'm not having an affair. l know about it, she told me about it.
She told you what? What did she tell you?
That's insane.
She's not Korean.
She's American.
She's American? l thought you said her name was Kim.
Her name is Kim.
This is not the point.
The point is that she told me this whole thing about you having an affair.
No, it's not true. l'm not having an affair. l have never touched another woman.
Then how do I know that this just isn't a lie?
You gotta be cool to do that. lt took me six months to even put a move on you. l know.
She didn't say anything about my health, right?
Seriously. l know, because I had this whole night
We'll still have a great night.
Come on, I want to, we're gonna celebrate.
Okay, thank you.
Look at the size, why'd you get a stretch limo? lt's gigantic.
But that doesn't say we're celebrating. l'm joking, what's the matter with you? l'm gonna push them out of the way.
Good.
Have you been catching on what's going on here?
He's been completely snubbing me. lt's not even subtle, it's ridiculous.
Thank you.
Are you gonna get an appetizer or are you going straight to the main dish? l don't know.
What'll we do about that driver, let him sit in the car for the next couple of hours?
That's his night?
That's why he gets paid, he sits there and waits. lt's not a bad job. l know. But l'm uncomfortable with him just sitting out there waiting for us. l've decided that this is my favorite restaurant.
Shrimp are great, but I hate ordering the same thing.
What are we gonna do about dinner for, what's his name, Greg, the driver?
Should we buy him dinner? l don't know what to do.
How many times are we gonna talk about Greg?
He'll be hungry.
Should we order a dinner for him?
Are you gonna finish that shrimp?
Your last shrimp?
Yes, I am gonna finish that, thank you.
Boy, l'm almost full already.
And you're a shrimp ahead of me.
What do you think, are you gonna eat that?
No, l'm gonna give it to the limo driver.
You don't have to, you want to finish it, go ahead.
No, l'm telling you l'm done.
Just, like, leftovers?
But I didn't touch any of the shrimp. l divided the rice very carefully. lt's all clean, it's all good.
How am I supposed to eat?
We should've got the guy a dinner.
Giving him leftovers like that, that was crazy.
Okay. l'll give him a fork, l'll be right back. l'll be right back, okay? l'll be right back.
Larry, how's it going?
Yeah, really spectacular.
Wonderful, do you mind telling me what you got in your pocket? l got a napkin and a fork.
There's a driver outside.
Pardon me for suggesting this, but it seems like you're walking out with our silverware. l am, in a way, but l'm not stealing it. l'm just borrowing it for a minute, and letting him eat his meal, then l'll get it back.
We're having dessert. l'll give him two minutes, and get back the fork. l call that stealing.
Okay, I know what this is about.
You know what, l'm not good at artificial small talk. l'm gonna call the police.
You'll be appearing at the West Los Angeles municipal court.
That would've been the better thing to do, right?
That's really what I should've done.
Do you have a tattoo of a star?
How did you know that?
Cheryl, what are you doing?
Larry? ln the matter of Larry David, the record reflect the presence of Mr David.
This case is here for sentencing.
Mr David, you wish to be heard before I impose sentence on you?
Yes, Judge Katz.
And may I say, ''Shabbat shalom. '
Mr David, I need your help in this.
And you think this is a fitting punishment? lsn't it a joy?
Temple can be quite grueling, as you well know.
You know, Mr David, l've been thinking about this.
Hi, Larry. l didn't beat my wife.
How's the shrimp, Al?
Are you enjoying the shrimp from the Chinese restaurant?
Evening.
That was a water bottle in my pants.
A water bottle.
Here's a good question 'What idiot runs ABC?'
Really? you can't just say you're giving up red meat.
There has to be some motivation behind it.
No reason.
Gonna invest in the restaurant?
Gonna come to the meeting tomorrow?
Yeah, a couple other people.
Got the manager and the assistant manager from Gus.
Great fun, come on.
I'll bet that's true.
I'll bet that's true.
Hey. Hey, buddy, what's the deal?
Doesn't garbage belong in a garbage can?
My garbage belongs in my garbage can.
Your garbage belongs in your garbage can.
Next guy I see throwing garbage in there,
I'm gonna kick his ass.
I'll give that message to the next guy.
Hi. How you doing?
Yeah.
Horrible, yeah.
I'm gonna get the catalogs.
How's everything?
Good. I mean, she's talked about Chet the whole time.
She's been like that all afternoon.
I mean, I don't know what to do about this thing.
You gave her this picture five months ago. for four months now.
I'll bring it up before we go.
Okay, I think these are the ones.
That is exactly the kind of shirt that I would wear. Don't you think?
Thank you for lunch.
That was really great.
You don't know.
Okay, all right.
It's just it's such
On Wilshire Boulevard.
Yes, of course.
I wonder if it comes in any other colors.
How's that going?
I don't know.
Cause it's kind of been like five months, you know?
And we were just wondering.
My husband dropped dead.
God forbid it should ever happen to you, Cheryl.
Bobo's? I like that.
Are you in on this too?
Are you in on this too?
What are you doing, throwing your money away?
You ever done anything like this?
I once invested in a whorehouse.
I'm great, man, I'm great.
She's in Australia shooting that film still.
Which is too bad, because she's going crazy.
She's missing
Him? I do an unbelievable Lion.
Well, I got to do the Lion, though, seriously.
Let me do the Lion.
You will not regret it.
I won't come if I have to do the Tin Man.
I'll be the fat Tin Man that'll disappoint children.
I saw a dead guy's picture.
Everybody, Larry David.
Hey, Michael York, how you doing?
Nice to meet you, Larry.
Pleasure to meet you.
I'll be managing the restaurant. Jim Swenson.
I was at Gus', too.
Let's sit, let's sit.
I don't know if I'm gonna come in on this.
I have to say.
We have a very exciting place here.
The location is perfect. And we got great ideas for a new restaurant.
It's going to be a hit.
Well, I know one thing,
I will not be giving you people any money if you serve kabobs.
Have you had a bad experience with kabobs? What happened?
I'm a little afraid of the stick, frankly.
No kabobs.
How about this idea?
What if three or four people are ringing the thing at once?
I'm surprised you're not on board with that.
It's English.
It's a butler bell.
What else do you have?
What are you doing for the waiters' uniforms?
We have a very tasteful white shirt, dark slacks, and name tags.
I'll go shopping for uniforms.
Is everybody good with that?
Welcome aboard.
There are tons of people with money.
Maybe they could, but I'm lucky I was asked.
We should look at it like a good thing.
We could hang out there.
How's everything?
Are you enjoying it?
I thought you didn't like talking to people.
I don't like talking to people I know, but strangers
I have no problem with.
I think it'll be fun.
I was put in charge of uniforms.
I'm very interested in.
I always wondered,
How do they choose the uniforms?
Well, I'm going to choose the uniforms.
I'm going shopping with Jeff to pick out uniforms for the waiters.
It's not only uniforms, you're making other decisions.
Cause you can't get sweet potatoes anywhere. Have you noticed that?
Everybody's noticed that.
They never come when you want them.
Did you bring this up at the meeting?
How did that go over?
Is that a new shirt?
Yeah, this is the shirt
They had three left.
Really?
You went shopping?
I did. I love the shirt.
It paid for me to open my mouth.
And your dentist called and wants us over for dinner Saturday.
I thought that you'd know what that meant.
He's my dentist.
Why is he calling me for dinner?
I don't know.
Well, what are we gonna talk about, my teeth?
I didn't know what to say.
I thought you guys talked about it.
I've never mentioned anything to him about getting together.
That's a terrible combination.
If we don't, then he's gonna be offended.
I invited you, why didn't you invite me? You know what I mean?
That's the end of this dentist for all intents and purposes.
I'm telling you, it's already ruined.
Got to get together.
The whole world's got to get together.
Hey. How about this?
That's what you want the waiters to wear?
No, they should walk around looking like you.
That's interesting.
I'm not finding anything.
I might even get another one for me.
Is it crazy to have two of the same shirt?
No, it's fine. You get a stain on it, you got another one.
I don't know if you remember.
I was in a couple days ago,
You had three in the basement.
Yeah, the cream and black.
Look at that shirt.
Is that a beauty, the epaulets?
Yes, exactly, it's a military shirt.
I don't know where you're going with this.
Have you ever seen
But I can imagine they're all there in their brilliant uniforms. but that has nothing to do with anything.
Excuse me.
Burt Bondy.
I think I know you spin class at the gym.
Burt?
Are you a friend of Bill W.'s?
In the program?
AA? I think I know you from there, don't I?
What is your name?
I know you from the waiting room at the dentist's office.
Dr. Blore.
Burt Bondy.
You don't want me to say hello?
Very high level.
I got to get there.
Burt Bondy?
What was that all about?
My dentist invited me out to dinner.
I'm supposed to be going tonight, and I told him I was out of town.
Sir?
It's kind of got a little French quality to it, no?
Yeah, French Foreign Legion, maybe, but, no.
They might think we have
Scientologists for wait people.
Are you kidding me? You don't like this?
Is that what you're saying?
I look at that and I see we're serving airline food.
Simple, simple, simple.
Now, here's where it all comes together.
Ladies and gentlemen,
A vest, a vest, a navy vest.
Simple, lovely.
It feels good.
It's very classy, right?
It's along the lines of what we're talking about.
Actual applause, mind you.
That's nice.
That's great. Thanks, Lar, that's really sweet of you.
Well, just take it back.
I don't even know where this store is.
It's on Wilshire and Eighth.
I don't understand.
You want me to take it back?
I just gave you a gift.
You gave me a defective shirt.
It's got a hole in it.
That's not a gift.
I don't own this shirt anymore, as I see it. I gave it to you.
All right, how about
I give you a gift, and you have to pick it up in Seattle?
That's a problem, not a gift.
I'm giving you a gift.
It is the same thing.
I appreciate the gesture. Thank you.
Thank you, everybody,
I appreciate that.
It just seems like you're taunting Ted.
When I buy a new shirt,
Hi, Jill, happy birthday.
Hi, Larry.
I like your tiara, that's nice.
Actually, change of plans.
I want Jeff to do the Lion.
You can be the Tin Man.
I don't want to do the Tin Man.
I have no connection to the Tin Man,
I don't like the Tin Man.
It's a kid's party.
You'll be fine, Lar, really.
No reason?
There's got to be a reason.
Larry, it's a party.
Let's lighten up, come on.
Cause I wore the shirt?
Because of the shirt?
No, don't be silly, Larry.
Let's have a good time.
If I can't do the Lion,
I won't do the Tin Man.
I'll be right back, sweetheart,
What? She's five years old.
She doesn't know how to spell.
I'm not gonna do the Tin Man.
Let me hear you do the voice. Do it.
I'm the Lion.
I don't have to do the voice.
He's doing a great job.
Did you see us come down the Yellow Brick Road?
She broke my teeth.
She didn't mean to, Larry.
My shirt.
Dr. Blore?
Burt Bondy.
You know what?
Maybe I need a little more novocaine.
No, it's gonna kick in.
It's fine, yeah.
It's getting there.
I feel it getting numb.
Good, I'll give it a minute.
Anyway, thanks for doing this.
I know dentists don't like to come in on Sundays.
It's like a sacred day.
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, you know?
Happy to do it.
It would've been great.
My cousin's got a pear farm up there.
A pear farm?
Like an orchard, right?
Bartlett pears.
I like pears.
They're delicious, but all weekend long, pear after pear.
I was getting the runs up there after a while.
Well, fruit will do that.
I'd much rather have been in your house on Saturday night than eating pears.
And it's relatives.
What are you gonna do?
And he's still got relatives there.
Yeah, and they're still making a living off of these pears for over 100 years now.
Everybody knows a Bartlett pear, right?
They start off green, then they turn brown.
I thought that was the Bosc that was the brown.
No, no. It's the Bartlett.
Burt Bondy was in this week.
Burt Bondy?
Do I know him? I don't know.
I think we're ready.
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?
How did it go?
Look at that. These are supposed to be temporaries, okay?
See the size of these things?
Because Bondy obviously told him that he ran into me and I wasn't out of town,
And he did this to get even. but temporaries aren't supposed to look like Ch and c and ets and 
I can imagine that you know very little about temporaries.
I don't want to have a conversation with you about temporaries.
Did you see what's on?
If you just would've done the Tin Man, none of this would've happened.
Maybe Jill did it on purpose too.
That's a possibility.
Maybe you shouldn't have called Ted an asshole.
Look at this shirt.
Look at this.
The one I bought for Ted, and I bought an extra one, see?
You know, it's not funny, Cheryl.
I honestly am concerned about that.
Can I come in?
That's an awful thing to happen.
Let me see.
You know what?
Can I just give you a word of advice?
It's a dangerous game.
And even if the candy comes down, then you've got vultures coming and getting candy, stuffing it in their pocket, killing each other to get to the candy.
It's a crazy game, it's dangerous.
I don't know how the Spaniards do it.
How long have they been doing this pi?ata?
I hope you know Jill did not do that on purpose.
Really, she feels terrible about it.
Five years old, she can spell asshole.
That's pretty good.
Hey, you know what?
On the way up here,
I was thinking,
I would like that shirt.
I'll take it and I'll exchange it.
It was a great gift.
You can't exchange anymore.
They're out.
I can take it to a shirt guy, he'll fix it.
This one's ruined, as you can see, and I was kind of planning on keeping the other one.
The one you gave me?
The one you gave back to me.
I only gave it back to you because you were being rude about me having to exchange it.
You still nevertheless didn't accept my gracious gift,
Every time we get together, we push and pull like this.
Larry, Larry. I'm trying to watch
The Wizard of Oz.
You just said you have two shirts upstairs.
Go upstairs, give Ted his shirt, and you'll have one for yourself.
Hi, Ted.
You got two sh and rts?
Hey.
Just put it down.
There's a land that I heard of
Yeah, I'm going in for the same amount as you.
Yeah?
The Wizard of Oz.
You want to come back?
Come on in, have a seat.
Barbara, do you know Ted?
This was our movie.
If happy little bluebirds fly
No, no.
You know,
Not only do I think
I'm in love with her,
Yeah, Deborah.
Why would it?
Well, why has it for my whole life?
This is the one.
Is this the one?
It's not just like it used to be for me, you know, like a trophy.
What do you think of this color?
She's a Christian
She's a what?
She's a Christian Scientist?
I don't think you've ever said that in your entire life.
No one's ever told me they were dating a Christian Scientist.
Holy cow, a Christian Scientist.
It's a nightmare for me, because,
She doesn't have a medicine chest in her place.
Wait, one second.
I want to get one of these,
I don't have good luck with them.
You can't hear a radio when you go in a tunnel.
You have a lot of program, a lot of rings in that.
Okay, I'm gonna take this.
Listen, I meant to ask you this,
I have to hand in this special, and you know how I like you to watch it. It's not locked in yet.
I'd love to, sure. Why don't you come over with Deborah on Friday?
We can have dinner and watch the special.
That would be fantastic.
That would be phenomenal.
I mean, you know, she'd be thrilled.
Bravo.
Hey, it's working.
Yeah, I'm right outside
Cellular Depot.
I just got it.
You're my first call.
What are we doing on Friday night?
Okay, good, because
Richard's gonna come over with his new girlfriend Deborah and we'll watch his special.
Wait, how about this?
He could cater the whole thing. Great idea.
And you work out whatever the money is.
She's allergic to peanuts, no peanuts.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's right, my friends for a change.
Well, Deborah, I heard that you guys are going to the Emmys.
Gorgeous. Armando on Beverly, fits like a glove.
Maybe we'll see you guys walk down the red carpet.
She's got a whole party planned to watch it.
Randy. Can I have some ketchup please?
You don't ask a chef for ketchup.
This is good food.
Thank you.
What did you ask for ketchup for?
What are you crazy?
What?
You know what? I am never having you guys over for dinner again.
Why? What did I do wrong?
This is only just one show.
I can't wait to see it, Richard.
I love you for having me.
To have you guys here like this is great.
These are the best brownies
I have ever had.
Susie made them, my wife.
What's happening,
Larry?
Shit.
Yeah, I wish I had the answer to that.
We have this guy,
Mike, that comes in and I don't even know how to work the TV anymore, honestly.
Every week we have this guy come over and try to fix it.
You know what, Larry?
The Emmys are this Sunday and I am not gonna miss them.
We missed half the Knick game last year because of this shit.
This is ridiculous.
You're gonna have to fire Mike.
I don't know, he's black,
I don't want to fire him.
You don't want to fire a black guy?
Every week he comes in, he never fixes it.
We can't even watch his special.
That's ridiculous.
Fire your guy.
I got a good guy.
We should have one remote.
You need to call him, Larry.
Are you gonna call him?
Well, maybe we should play Scrabble.
Yeah, it is a joke,
Scrabble?
It's a joke, but what are we supposed to do?
You want to sit Shiva?
Why don't we play Twister, would you be happy?
Let's go upstairs and all get under the covers and sob.
Why don't we go to my house and watch it? What's wrong with that?
All right, fine, we'll go to your house.
I'll pack these brownies up.
I don't feel well.
I really don't feel well,
I don't think I can go.
What do you mean?
You don't feel well?
I'd like to go home,
I think.
Do you want an aspirin?
No, I can't take an aspirin, but, thank you.
No, no way. I don't like peanuts.
My wife never uses them.
I wouldn't allow that to happen.
There was no peanuts or peanut oil or anything in the dinner.
That she's allergic, right?
What?
No, you didn't.
He did, I was standing right next to him when he called you.
I didn't hear it, you never said it or I didn't hear it.
I'll bet the cell phone. I bet there was interference on the cell. all the time.
Jesus Christ,
I knew you fucked it up.
I fucked it up? What kind of stupid thing is that to say?
You don't know how to use a goddamn cell phone.
A praying mantis can use that goddamn phone.
I'd really like to go home.
All I can do really is wait it out.
Why don't we just go home and, can't you just, take a nap, and we can all watch it at my house?
You could take a nap.
I'd like you to take me home.
She needs to go home, Richard.
I feel very awkward about it.
What a shame.
We can't even get to watch the special.
I get home and I'll be fine.
You want to just drive home?
I don't feel comfortable driving myself.
She needs you to take her home.
You're such a fucking idiot, how can you do this?
Well, we'll watch it, don't worry.
You don't need to play, it's better with two.
Do you have any milk?
Just be honest, man.
Cause I'm black, right? Right?
Why? That couldn't be crazier.
Crazy. Why did I hire you?
That was over the phone, You didn't know I was black at the time.
All right, that's true, but I kept you around.
But you're getting rid of me, right?
I fire white people,
I've fired white people.
I have fired plenty of white people.
I've been doing this 15 years, all right?
Okay, okay. You know what?
It's not even me.
Okay.
Okay, let's be honest, okay?
It's my wife.
Please don't go there, man.
No, be man enough.
Look, be man enough. If you gonna be a racist, be a man, man.
I was a man.
What good did it do me?
Don't blame it on your wife. Thank you.
You're blaming it on your race.
What's worse?
I'd rather blame it on my wife than blame it on my race.
Right, whatever.
Okay, don't be mad.
I wish you wouldn't be mad about it.
I'm gonna recommend you to a lot of people.
Hey, Wanda.
Are you here for the prayer group?
I know.
Hello, I'm Deborah's mother.
Come.
Right this way.
This is our prayer group.
I'm doing on time.
Okay.
And Deborah's right in there.
I'll be fine to go to the Emmys.
Come on, look at you.
How can we have a ball?
She thinks she can go tomorrow night.
Will you tell him it's not that bad, is it?
Can you see out of that eye?
I can see, of course I can see.
Honey, they're bulging almost.
For crying out loud, hon.
Yeah, no, really.
I think it was more peanuts than the cell.
He recommended this phone to me.
Tell him I'll be fine by tomorrow night.
He's a sensible man, on occasion.
I'll be fine.
Sweetie, I'll be fine.
You know what you should think about?
You should take Benadryl.
You'd knock that out in five minutes.
The thing would be gone.
You wouldn't even think about it.
I can't believe
Pop it in?
That's a betrayal of my faith.
Jesus would be very happy for you to look better than you do now.
No one's watching.
Pop, take a pop.
Listen, I have spent my entire life in belief and faith.
Well, why not just pray for the TV?
Why not just pray?
Pray for the TV?
What is that? What?
Hey, by the way, is that guy any good?
I don't know.
It's my parents' house.
I just had to fire our guy.
I'd like one remote that could take care of the whole thing.
I don't know if he's good, Lar.
Do you have one remote, or two?
Come.
Just in time.
We're about to begin the prayer circle.
You've gotta be kidding.
Believe me, you don't want me in this.
She'll wind up with tuberculosis.
I really got bad karma,
I'm not kidding.
Grab hands.
Let's do boy and girl here.
Join hands.
Join hands.
Put her over here.
No, she needs to be over there with her husband.
And as we continue this healing light, we know, Jesus, that You are with us, and You are always with us, for Thine is the power, and the glory, forever and ever.
No one can touch us, for God is always with us.
I just got this cell phone.
Maybe.
Who are they playing?
This is a fucking nightmare.
You know why this is a nightmare?
You, my friend.
Yes, yes, you.
Hey. It had nothing to do with that.
If it wasn't for the peanuts, she wouldn't look like a goddamn fucking Venetian.
The cell phone that you recommended didn't work.
That cell is used by every fucking person.
You said you didn't give a shit about the way she looks.
Part of that is true, but this is unbelievable.
These people, what are they doing?
I don't understand this attitude.
I don't understand it either.
Take a Benadryl.
She'll be better in five minutes.
Can you imagine me getting out of the limo with my date?
She's pretty hell bent on going too.
She's got the dress,
I got the dress.
Yeah, know what would match her head?
She should look in the mirror.
Like a hit man?
A Benadryl hit man?
Put it in the brownie that she ate.
Wait a minute, why not put it in?
First of all, she will never know.
I've got news for you.
Even if she got better, they would think it was because of the prayer.
That's fantastic.
What, are they gonna throw me in prison?
All I have to do is get the recipe from Susie,
Cheryl would bake them, put it in, we'd just give her the brownie.
Well we need protection.
It's me and Sammy in the house alone.
He's a good boy.
This is Oscar.
Yeah. You just stop by, you don't call?
No, I tried to call, but my cell phone couldn't get through.
Who's that?
What do you want?
Wait a minute.
Jeff brought brownies that I made to a dinner party? specifically for Sammy to take to school the next day, and they were gone.
I had no idea what the hell happened.
You see what we're dealing with here?
He stole brownies out of the mouth of his baby.
It's a testament to the brownie.
That's what you're not seeing.
Because they're incredible brownies.
If they were mediocre brownies, he wouldn't have taken them.
I would love if you could give me the recipe.
No, I can't, because it's a secret family recipe my grandmother handed down to me, I can't.
Susie, Susie, Susie.
Look who you're talking to here.
I'm talking to Larry David.
Yeah, the guy who never ever tells anybody anyth and ng.
I am known for that.
Strangers come up to me to tell me their deepest secrets.
Well, that's good to know for future reference for other things that I might need to trust you with, but this is a secret.
What does that mean to you?
Okay, okay, secret, secret, secret.
I'll tell you a secret, how about that?
Nobody knows, not even Cheryl.
Well, if you'd like to tell me.
It's not definite.
The point is, I'm telling you,
It's not The Manhattan Project, you know?
You're asking too much.
You ask way too much.
I can't. Oscar, come.
I just told you
I'm gonna lose a ball.
A lot of Benadryl.
Are you kidding?
What's the downside?
I'm begging you.
Aren't you guys supposed to be going to the Emmys tomorrow night?
Is that what this is about, Larry?
Because you don't want to take her to the Emmys because of the way she looks?
Why should he take her?
She's hideous. I don't blame him.
Are you guys out of your mind?
Why?
It's not only that.
I want her to get better.
It's 90 percents.
She takes a little Benadryl, you put it in the brownie, big deal.
You can't do that because the brownie will fall apart.
It's gotta be in the mix when you make the brownie.
What do you mean? They have to be baked. They have to be baked.
Don't you think she's gonna taste Benadryl in the brownies?
It's totally tasteless.
There's no taste to this stuff.
There's no taste to it.
There's no taste to it at all.
They're odorless and tasteless.
My heart is breaking for her big head.
It's grotesque. It's like she should be in a carnival on Coney Island,
I'm telling you.
I have heard in a long time.
You know what?
It's a good idea, 'cause if it works, she thinks the prayer did it.
Now the idea is a genius idea.
It's not like, How did I get better all of a sudden?
And you know what?
It happened in our house.
All right, I just want to talk to her for a second.
All right. Cheryl?
All right, thanks for doing this.
I guess this is stupid.
Let's not make a big deal about it, okay? It's not really a big deal.
No, I'll do it,
I'll do it, just go.
Can you bake this stuff?
I don't even know, can you bake?
Please?
My wife baked them.
I'll take them to her.
Hey, you know what?
If it's all the same to you.
I would really like to see the look on her face when I give these to her.
It would mean a lot to me.
Thank you very much.
Brownies.
No peanuts.
My wife got the recipe.
Go ahead, take a little taste.
You like that?
You know, they're not quite the same.
Tell Cheryl I said thank you for making the effort, but those are really not the same.
What are you talking about?
They're delicious, eat it. It's good.
It's good, take it.
These are definitely not the same brownies.
Not the same brownies?
It's the same brownie.
They're definitely not the same.
Believe me, they're the same brownie.
My wife baked them.
I can't believe that she doesn't know the difference between sugar and salt.
Save them for later, save it.
What do you want me to say,
Larry? They're horrible.
What time are you picking me up tomorrow night for the Emmys?
I feel like nothing's happening, wait.
What?
I can't get the satellite to go on.
It was working yesterday, just follow the instructions.
Just get in here and fix the damn thing.
We're missing Joan.
You can't wait three hours? lt'll come on regular TV.
We want to watch it when the New Yorkers watch it.
We need to see the PreShow with Joan.
We're missing that now.
We need to see what everyone's wearing.
That's the best part.
The business with the black guy.
You fixed his tip?
What do you mean, So?
You didn't know? Larry's a tip profiler.
What am I supposed to do?
If it wasn't a racial thing, why'd you do it behind his back?
I didn't do it behind his back.
He tiptoed back
I didn't tiptoe, he stormed out in a huff.
I would've done it right in front of his face, but he stormed out.
You fired him?
You fired him?
Why'd you fire the black man?
I fired the black man because he's the guy who set up the whole system here and it doesn't work.
He's here every week,
I'm giving him checks.
We've got five remotes,
I can't turn it on, but I know, you know, Black man, he can never do anything wrong, and he shouldn't get fired from a job.
Black people always do everything right.
You gotta turn the damn satellite on for the TV to work.
See the little green light?
Just gotta turn it on.
Or you can fire the black man.
Whatever works for you.
Jessica Alba and her fianc?.
Great, thank you.
Who's that?
Jane Kaczmarek?
Yeah, she's funny.
There's Kelsey Grammer and his girlfriend.
It's Richard Lewis.
Richard, over here.
Richard, Richard.
Come on, it's Joan.
I've seen better faces on a hemorrhoid. did you pick up the phone?
Excuse me.
How are things
My agent calls, he has an audition for me for a biker. and I get my Hell's Angels jacket on and my leather, and I bust into the room.
You were laughing hard.
I guess you couldn't hear the door.
That was funny.
Yeah.
I'll go upstairs, no big deal, and I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, no,
I gotta go.
And I will see you Thursday and we'll do it again.
Bye, Brad.
What's going on?
No, I'm not jealous.
I can't have a friend?
Play tennis, I don't care.
He still wants to sleep with you.
He's attracted to you, and he wants to have sex with you.
That's right, yeah.
You know what? I wouldn't even be playing tennis with him if you played tennis with me.
You want to play tennis with me?
I'll play tennis with you, fine.
Okay.
Yeah, call him up, say you're playing tennis
Boy, the restaurant's looking good.
Yeah, three weeks away.
You happy you did it?
This is very cool.
I'm glad you talked me into it.
Yeah, how you doing?
Yesterday I get home, and there's this guy in my living room who plays tennis with my wife.
He's an actor.
I said, it's wrong.
She's got this, what, this heterosexual friend?
I'll play tennis with you.
Now I got to play tennis with her.
Is that coffee?
Give me table salt, we've got a spill.
Give me a towel.
What are you doing?
This is an old restaurant trick.
Pour club soda on the stain and then you put on table salt.
Club soda and then salt, huh?
Get out of here.
Really?
This has to set a few minutes, then it'll be fine.
Well, I love that.
We need to talk.
Hey, Randy.
Hey, Jeff.
I'm out, guys.
What do you mean, what are you talking about?
I can't cook in this restaurant.
I'm no good, I suck.
What?
That's ridiculous.
You don't want me.
I'm doing you a big favor, believe me.
What is this about, the peanuts?
Is that what this is about?
You can't go by him.
Where's this coming from?
What are you talking about?
It's coming from the pressure.
This is going to be a big celebrity restaurant,
I've been reading the publicity.
This place is gonna get reviewed, you know.
You've built this up in your imagination. This is crazy.
It is not me. Can't do it.
Can't.
Hey, Randy.
What?
Huh.
He just quit.
Randy just quit?
He was upset, he didn't feel like he can do it.
Was it the whole peanut thing?
Is that what upset him?
No, we never mentioned the peanut thing.
No, he feels pressure.
Do we have any ideas, like, three weeks away, what are we gonna do?
I don't know anybody, no.
Wait a minute. Josh.
Josh would be great.
The guy who cooks for us at home.
He'd be fabulous.
If we could come over and try it.
Yeah.
Obviously we'd have to come over and sample it, right?
He got it all out.
The stain's gone.
The trick is to get to the stain before it dries.
I'm getting them that apartment on Barrington.
All right.
Hey, Melanie, Ed.
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Hey, good.
Lawrence.
Hi.
It's good to see you guys.
Thank you.
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
She was acting like she doesn't even know me.
When was the last time you called her?
You know, we never really bought 'em a wedding gift.
And it's been over a year.
Every time we run into them
I don't want it to be like that.
But it's ridiculous to harbor a grudge because we didn't get a present.
We went out of our way to fly to Chicago to their wedding.
Buy 'em a car.
You okay?
If we were playing doubles it would've been good.
You know what?
You gotta stop the grunting.
What are you talking about?
You grunt on every shot.
Every shot you hit, you, Ungh. Ungh.
You don't hear it?
That's how I play.
I didn't even know I was doing it.
You grunt every shot.
How do you like this?
Would you like to listen to this, huh?
Ungh.
I don't mind it.
Ungh.
All right, that's the game.
And set.
I'm not kidding.
Cause it's not exactly white.
Is this boring you?
I don't know.
If you had said to me,
I'd go, No kidding?
Where'd you get them?
Tony and Tina's Wedding?
I think I might go on Friday.
Oh.
I didn't know that you'd want to go.
I'm throwing it out there.
Why wouldn't I want to go?
I enjoy the theater as much as the next guy.
Oh.
What is wrong with you?
You're thinking about going to see
Brad is in it.
I want us to go see
Tony and Tina's Wedding.
Yeah.
You know what?
Go see Tony and Tina's Wedding.
That's fine.
No, I want us to go together.
Yeah, I heard what you said.
I'll just go see the show and go home. Don't worry about me.
You're reading things into it.
I think you're completely reading things into this.
I don't think so.
I am not.
Listen, I want to go with you.
No.
Don't you want to go with me?
I don't know. It depends on what you'll do for it.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you have a problem with that?
No, I like this.
All right, don't worry about it.
It's cranberry juice.
I saw this at the restaurant today.
Gets the whole stain out.
You know what? It's an old rug.
Don't worry about it.
No, no, no.
Wait till you see this.
You're gonna be amazed.
Time's of the essence.
Where's the salt?
I hope I'm not too late.
That's the only thing I hope.
I hope I'm not too late.
Now the salt, salt all over.
Don't spare the salt.
And you are gonna be amazed at how this works.
That's it.
That's all you need to do.
Are you out of your mind?
Come on, we got a few minutes.
Gonna dry.
I gave you a window of opportunity that has slammed closed.
What do you mean you gave me a window of opportunity?
No.
All right.
When you get up tomorrow morning, that stain's gonna be all gone.
You watch.
Hey. Come on in.
Hope you're hungry.
Good, good, good, good.
You're in for a treat.
He's very excited.
Hey, Josh.
Hi, gentlemen.
How are you? I'm Josh.
Larry.
I just want to thank you for the opportunity for possibly being your chef for the new restaurant.
I'm gonna run back in but I will see you in a bit.
Thank you.
What do you mean, what did I do?
Why did you tell him that we were coming for that purpose?
You didn't have to tell him the whole thing.
He's a good cook.
Relax, come enjoy.
Come on, seriously.
You're impossible.
That's a nice shirt.
Yeah, my mom got it for me.
She dropped it off at the office.
What is that?
Don't know.
It's very comfortable.
All right, all right, what do you think? Come on.
Yeah, great.
He knows his stuff.
What do you think,
Larry?
Eh.
What do you mean, Eh?
Eh.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
What do you know about food?
Thin people know more about food than fat people.
I have more food experience than you, my friend.
I never got laid a lot, but that doesn't mean the guy who got laid more than me appreciated it any more.
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
He might know more about sex but he doesn't appreciate it any more.
I appreciate it.
You know, you are such a pain in the ass.
All right, fine. What are we gonna do?
What do you want to do?
No, I mean, what do you want to do about Josh?
He worked his heart out for this meal.
Well, you know, what are we supposed to do?
We can't hire him if we don't all agree on it.
Josh.
Gentlemen, how was everything?
Did you enjoy your lamb?
Good. Did you enjoy the plum, apricot, and mint chutney?
The chutney was amazing.
Thank you very much. Yes?
Yes, Larry?
It was good.
What was wrong with it?
A little saucy.
A little too saucy.
Saucy?
Yeah, kind of saucy.
Was there anything else?
I guess dessert's out of the question.
Okay.
And you have decaf?
I'd love a decaf too.
A little bit of skim milk.
Okay.
What should we get for their wedding present?
I love how these people take their shopping carts bring 'em home and leave them there.
You know, I really don't like not driving.
You should've let me drive.
It's my car.
On the way back,
I'm gonna drive.
Why?
No, really.
You want me to sing, or you want the radio?
I think I'd rather the radio.
All right.
What are you doing with a tape?
I thought you only buy CDs.
Actually, a friend loaned it to me.
Who is this?
It's Al Green.
Who gave you this tape?
Brad.
It's good, isn't it?
You oughta be with me?
Is that what he's saying?
That's what he's singing about?
What is wrong with you?
Wait, Brad gives you a tape?
You oughta be with me?
You know what,
I swear to God, this thing gets worse every time.
Every day, this story is getting worse and worse and worse.
All right.
What about a nice bowl, huh?
You know what?
They've probably got tons of bowls.
I feel like I'm not gonna find anything in here.
Because they probably have all this stuff, right?
Why don't we just get them a nice piece of fish?
We should just go next door to that wine shop and get an expensive bottle of wine. Let's do that.
I don't know.
It's got to be a good one,
All right, are you coming?
What, between this and a wine store? No, I'll stay here.
All right,
I'll be right back.
Okay.
I'm just browsing.
Yeah, you got that bewildered look.
I know it's a lot to take in.
You know what?
I appreciate it.
I'm not really shopping.
I'm kind of browsing.
If I need help,
Just this week.
Not just these, there's a million more.
You know what? I'm really not interested in buying anything.
But thank you.
I'm not interested, but thank you.
Okay.
Flatware is always great.
All right, look. Can you stop following me around, please?
I'm not interested in buying anything.
Stop following me.
I don't really understand what's giving you that idea.
You've done a complete circle with me now in the store.
Why are you here if you're not interested in buying anything?
You've never heard of browsers?
Is that word unfamiliar to you, a browser?
You know what?
We should drop this off at the Loebs.
You know, we're in the neighborhood.
Hello?
Hey, Cheryl. Brad.
Nothing.
Pretty good.
Hey Larry, still looking for a chef?
Actually, I am.
Well, my friend, Paul is the chef at Alsace and he's thinking about leaving.
I know that place, Alsace.
That's a good restaurant.
Why don't we go eat there after the show, and you can check out the food?
Larry's in the car.
What?
Larry's in the car. better save it for another time because Larry's in the car.
I was letting him know, to be polite.
I mean, I think that you would be excited.
He might have found a chef.
I actually am.
I think that could be good.
I'll call Ted and Jeff and set it up.
Okay.
Jesus Christ.
What did you do?
Let me see your driver's license, sir.
Sir, we had a report from a young lady on her cell phone saying you've been following her in your car.
I'm going to drop off a bottle of wine.
It's a friend's house in Moreno.
I can't believe you were doing this.
This guy came into the store where I work and accused me of following him around, and then had, like,
You're turning left when I'm turning left, turning right when I'm turning right.
This is, like, your sick revenge?
You follow me around and scare me like that?
Would you explain to me why you've been following this lady?
I'm not following her.
I was in a store, how to work in a store.
People ask you to leave them alone, and you harass them.
I was not following you,
I work there.
We're in a residential neighborhood here, please.
You know what?
You are.
Sir, why don't you stay in your car for a moment?
I'll be right back with you.
Maybe we should've called first.
We're right in the neighborhood.
What's the difference?
Sure. You got a gift, you drop by.
And thought we'd drop off your wedding gift.
We got married 14 months ago.
You can't give a gift after a year, you know that.
I know, that's why
You can't give a gift after a year?
What happens after a year?
You can give it with an apology.
This is a beautiful bottle of wine.
We just spent $300 on this bottle of wine for you and you're not accepting it?
Is that what you're saying?
We can't take the gift after a year.
You had no problem taking the $200 engagement vase we got you.
You had no problem with the shower gift.
What'd you get her?
Then we flew to Chicago for your little wedding bash.
You're into us now for about $5,500, as I see it.
First of all, it was not a little wedding.
We had 266 people there.
If it was too expensive, you shouldn't have come, Larry.
They don't want the wine.
You would do the same thing.
I know you would do the same.
By the way, do you have anybody in there to clean up the mess
I'm about to make?
You know what
I was just thinking, maybe you should've worn a sports coat.
He might be an actor.
That might be part of his character.
Oh.
All right, I'm gonna go use the bathroom.
Okay, I'll grab a pew.
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Angelo.
Antola,
Angelo Antola.
Hi, Brad.
Brad?
Brad, you know, cut the shit, okay?
Shit? Brad? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Yeah, yeah, me and Tina, we're close.
It's a shame she's gonna marry that jerk.
Only doing it for the money.
She don't love him.
She doesn't love him.
But me and Tina, that's a different story.
Between the two of us, no one would understand, really.
Yeah, well, you're a very complex person.
Thank you. We have a better understanding of things than that cocksucker.
Yeah, he's a cocksucker, Tony.
Yeah, one day, me and Tina, we'll end up together, cause this will never work.
Then I'll finally slip her the sausage.
That very formidable sausage of yours.
And she will be forever grateful, my friend.
Yeah, it's been fun doing this little improv with you.
Improv, whatever you want to call it.
I'll see you later at the restaurant.
At the reception, you bet, you bet.
I'll swing by, I'll say hello.
Yeah, well, good, that's good, okay, yeah.
I'll see you later, okay?
I'll see you later.
Okay.
You guys missed a great show.
You should check it out.
Nothing funnier than shtick in the bathroom.
It was good, it was good.
You should check it out.
I'll tell you what, we should order everything on the menu.
I know, it was a surprise.
They actually didn't accept the gift.
Hey, what's your problem?
What is your problem?
Cheryl, don't move.
I've got it under control.
I need club soda and salt.
Hey, you, turn around, look at her, right there.
She called the cops on you.
Look at me.
I need salt,
I need salt.
I'm talking to you. I said look at me.
I will kick your ass right now.The restaurant investors plan a pool party, but only Larry and Jeff show up. Larry goes to use the bathroom in the main house, and winds up getting the nanny fired. Larry recommends the nanny to Jeff and Susie. After the nanny snaps, Suzie's life is threatened. Meanwhile, Richard Lewis tries to get into Bartlett's Book Of Quotations for claiming to have invented the phrase the ______ from hell.
Hey, I'll take a Seven and Seven.
Got to plumb.
What is this thing, marble, this bar?
Yeah.
Ever schlep marble?
You ought to try schlepping marble one day.
It's a schlep.
Good, how are you doing?
I gotta talk to the meat guy, see you guys later.
Hello, Hugh.
All right, all right.
Well, that's terrific.
Hopefully see you Sunday.
Didn't you tell me that you're the head
And you do Bartlett's
Quotations, right?
That is the flagship of our fleet, yeah.
Okay, 'cause my friend,
Richard Lewis, wants to get into
Bartlett's Quotations.
He has a quotable quote?
He coined the phrase,
The blank from hell.
No, that's his.
The blank from hell, yeah.
Okay.
Hey. How are you?
Wearing a bathing suit?
You going swimming?
That's it, okay?
Susie's pregnant.
No, it is, it's really good.
It's good, trust me.
It'll all be fine.
I was saying to my wife,
You should let me date, because it'll bring us much closer.
I'll come home, we'll talk about the date.
You'll say, 'How did the date go?
Yeah, after I told her about my date.
But what if you ended up getting laid from the date?
I'd tell her about that too.
We went back to her place, we had sex and I had to make up an excuse to leave and whatever.
That's beautiful.
I like that.
Hey, look at this.
Where are we gonna buy our bread?
Our favorite bakery.
What's going on? You guys are going out of business?
We got here just in time, didn't we?
We're still in business.
We're thriving.
Great.
Yeah, we need probably a cake, right?
Wait, wait, wait, are you kidding me?
Nobody's gonna eat that.
This is the best
I know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, we'll take that.
We'll take it, but no one's gonna eat it.
No wonder you're going out of business.
Mellon, huh?
You know, it's a little ostentatious.
It's like eating a delicious sponge.
It's like eating a delicious sponge.
Did I tell you? my grandmother's mah jong game.
That doesn't mean it's not good.
But where, tell me?
It's moot, they're going out of business.
They're going out of business, Jeff.
What do you need to know?
That's a good bakery.
They're going out of business?
Maybe they're retiring.
I don't know. Anyway, where's the bathroom?
You have to use the cabana.
They won't let you in the house.
What?
No, they won't let you in the house.
They want people to use the cabana bathroom.
He thinks the rules don't apply to him.
The cabana across from the pool, they have the restroom in there.
Outside sandbox only.
Straight over there.
There's plenty of toilet paper.
Why can't I go?
I'm not wet or anything.
I'm not gonna dirty the house.
I'll wipe my feet.
I know Mr Mellon.
I wouldn't worry about it, okay?
I'll take care of the whole thing.
I really have to go.
It'll take two seconds.
This is fine. This is silly.
It's just a bathroom.
Glad you could make it.
Larry, how did you get into the bathroom? my way in there.
Nobody can turn down the David charm once I turn it on.
Do you know what I'd do if I had to go? Sprint and run her over.
Meanwhile, have you seen anybody from the restaurant here?
Nope, nope, only us.
What about Michael York?
No, we're the only idiots to accept these invitations.
Nobody from the restaurant?
What?
Look what's going on with this kid.
Wow.
Honestly, it's huge.
It's bigger than mine.
He's got a bigger penis than me.
Isn't that Hugh's kid?
Oy vey is mir.
Let's just go.
Let's just go.
You know what?
Cheryl's right, let's go.
We got a freak show here.
Where are you going?
Please, it's not funny.
Gee.
That's it right there.
All right.
This is unbelievable.
What?
They stuff you in like sardines here.
The guy deserves to make a living.
This is gonna be a great lunch.
Look at this.
Relax, man, just relax.
I can't even talk.
You can't say anything.
Direct it right to me.
It's like having a whisper lunch.
I have a dental appointment
Hey, I spoke to the Hugh Mellon guy.
The blank from hell.
And he's interested.
He'll talk to his partner.
You might get into Bartlett's.
He's positive?
Does he feel good that it's me?
He didn't attribute it to me?
That really pisses me off that I don't get credit for that.
I don't blame you.
And at the pool party
I told him about your special.
Right.
Yeah, I'll be able to milk him a little bit.
No, that's cool.
Have you been getting all this?
This is the lunch from hell.
What did you say?
I'm saying, this is the lunch from hell.
Where'd you hear that expression?
This kills me.
Alsace, s'il vous pla?t.
I saw that.
What did you see?
What about Ted's guy?
What about Josh?
Josh cooked a beautiful meal, but Larry didn't like it.
It was a little saucy, a little saucy.
You got arms on your chair?
You've got arms on your chair.
Look at that.
I'm just getting a chair with arms.
Larry, what are you doing?
You want to focus?
At least I was at the pool party yesterday.
I'm trying to be part of this thing.
Jeff and I were the only ones who showed up.
It was a little embarrassing, yeah.
I think you all owe him an apology.
I told you I couldn't make it.
I'm glad you had a good time.
I wrote the wrong date in my book.
I was tied up at the last minute.
We have no chef.
It was a good party.
We had a great time.
Thank you for coming.
Enough about parties, what about chefs?
We need to take responsibility for getting a chef.
When I need a new editor
I get him, beg, borrow or steal.
I was in this restaurant the other day, it was a coffee shop.
I had a side dish of applesauce.
I have to tell you it was really fantastic.
We're gonna write that down.
Very helpful.
When you look for your chef,
Make sure they know a little about applesauce.
You buy it at a supermarket.
It comes in a jar.
We should consider it for the menu.
Encourage people even.
I think we're good,
I got to go to a meeting.
Everybody's gonna look, right?
If anyone finds anything out, call.
It's a very underrated side dish, that's my point.
It's an underrated side dish.
Did you really just sign
Sarah Jessica Parker to a recording contract?
Yeah, why not?
It's gonna work out.
Don't worry about it.
It's only money.
Big deal.
Yeah, my money, Larry.
See you later.
The weather worked out, it was great.
It was a little rude on their part, I thought.
I saw your son.
He's pretty good.
What are you saying?
What are you saying that to me for?
Hey, it's a compliment.
What's the big deal?
What's the compliment?
I'm not talking about your wife's tits. This is rude.
You could say my wife has nice tits as long as it's complimentary.
Come on, Hugh.
Hugh, not you,
Hugh, okay?
Hugh.
Hi.
Hi.
You remember Martine, the Mellons' nanny?
From the pool party.
Yeah, she's having a bit of a problem.
A problem, I'll say.
Mr Mellon fired me.
It's my suitcase, it doesn't have wheels.
It seems that one of the guests felt the cabana bathroom was beneath him and made his way into the main house.
How did he find out?
Margarita the cook.
She's got a problem with me.
She told that I was the person that let the guest in.
Of course I remember what you said about, you know, you would be responsible if anything happened.
Did you tell him that it was me?
No, I don't dime,
Your home is big.
You know what,
Is there any way that you could maybe talk to Mr Mellon and straighten things out?
Because I think if you spoke with him,
I can just stay here.
There won't be a problem.
What happened?
How about that thing?
It's huge.
Why would you do that, Larry?
I took a risk.
You know what?
I think you won't have a problem finding another job.
People in this town love nannies.
I'll need Mr Mellon as a reference if I get another nanny job.
He was my only reference, that was my first nanny job.
Before that, I worked at Magic Mountain in the Looney Tunes Lodge for 15 years.
It's where the Looney Tunes characters would come out and sign autographs for kids.
You know, Jeff and I went there once with his daughter.
Can I talk to you in the kitchen for just a second?
Sure.
I told you not to use that bathroom.
Why did she come over here?
Obviously she thinks
I'm responsible for getting her fired and has no place to go.
She brought her suitcase, did you see that?
I don't know what she thinks.
I don't want the nanny from hell in my house.
That expression?
My dad used to say it all the time.
You know, everything was from hell.
Richard Lewis coined that, Cheryl.
The point is, I do not want her here, okay?
You wouldn't believe what she's been telling me for the last 20 minutes.
She's full of nonsequiturs.
She tells me she likes to pet horses.
She enjoys a good corn dog.
Enjoys a good corn dog?
She's maybe a little eccentric, but she seems harmless.
Wait a second.
Jeff needs a nanny.
Susie's pregnant.
Their nanny just left.
She's pregnant.
That's why he moved back.
But they're looking for a nanny.
You know nothing about her.
She was a good nanny.
She didn't get fired for being a bad nanny.
She got fired for letting me use the bathroom.
If they don't like her, they don't have to use her.
We're doing them a favor.
You know, we gotta stop off do you have left?
I have a dozen left.
I don't have any more boxes.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Take it easy.
They're free.
Look at me.
This is Martine, the nanny
I was telling you about.
Hi, Martine,
I'm Susie Greene.
What the fuck is this?
What are these?
It's a birthday present for Jeff.
Larry, he's not fat enough as it is?
He needs this many?
This is ridiculous.
It's from Butterman's.
It's ridiculous.
They're not even in boxes.
Where are the boxes?
They're out of boxes.
You don't understand.
They're going out of business.
Larry, he's gonna explode.
I understand.
Should I care?
The baby.
Congratulations.
How did you know about that?
And you told her?
I don't even know her.
Who the hell is she?
You know what?
All right, look, why don't you come in and we'll have a little interview?
You look like a lovely woman.
I don't know what you want me to do.
I have no place to put them.
I don't have a freezer that's adequate for this.
Put them down in the kitchen.
Put them in the kitchen.
Martine, dear, come in.
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.
You already did it.
It's not a live performance.
You're gonna sit there.
Are they here now?
No, they don't come.
No, they see it in their private homes.
The privacy of their homes?
Is that the proper way of saying that sentence?
You know, you're like an English language cop.
It's unbelievable.
By the way, I was thinking, maybe you can introduce me to that Bartlett's guy.
Maybe I could schmooze a little bit before the special.
Yeah, well, there's a little problem with that.
What do you mean?
I don't know if you'll get that quote in.
He talked to him about the penis.
I was just curious.
You're kidding, is she okay?
You should never have brought it up, Larry. Fuck.
All right,
I'll be right home.
Your nanny attacked Susie.
What?
Is she okay?
If you leave me now,
I collapse.
You clapse?
Yeah, I'll collapse.
You don't say collapse, you say claps.
Why is the porn baby here?
Because he fired his nanny.
He doesn't have a nanny.
He has to take care of the kid now.
I don't want a little kid watching my specials.
I don't want a baby in the screening.
That's a good sign for the quote.
Shh, shh, shh.
I was a little burned out.
I have to sit through your cartoons, you watch this one.
Shh, yourself.
You shush. Shush.
No, these are all new and improved dysfunctions.
Don't speak to us again, all right?
I'm warning you.
He wouldn't be here if you didn't fire that nanny.
Fuck you.
Fuck Hugh.
Hugh.
Hugh.
Everything okay?
I called three times last night.
I haven't checked the messages.
I've been unbelievably busy.
Larry, that nanny, she was a sicko.
She was a mental case.
She was sick.
No, of course. Why would you send me a sicko?
Why would I do that?
That would make me deranged.
Well, she needs to be put away, this woman.
Well, what happened?
I left Sammy alone in her room watching TV.
All of a sudden, she starts screaming.
Mommy. Mommy.
She worked at that
Yeah, yeah.
She must have snapped from hearing it.
Larry, she went crazy,
I'm telling you.
She starts fighting with me.
She grabbed my arm.
She starts pulling me back and forth.
All of a sudden, I'm fighting with this crazy woman.
I mean, physically fighting.
Next thing I knew, we were out on the deck.
Out on the deck?
And then what happened?
She pushed me over the rail.
This crazy woman pushed me over the rail.
She was trying to kill me.
Here's the thing, Lar.
Four for David.
I'm not finding that.
Try Braudy.
Here we go, for four.
All right.
They haven't arrived.
Would you like to be seated?
I'm looking. They automate it right.
I'll tell you that.
What are you doing here?
Well, let me guess.
We're gonna take a nap, yeah.
Okay, I didn't mean to pry into your life there.
I meant, what are you doing in general?
What's going on?
You know what?
I'm investing in a restaurant.
What are you touching?
You'll be working there like a busboy?
I didn't invest.
I just went there and I left.
I didn't lock up.
See you there, Rocco.
I went with Rocco.
Night, Paul, see you later.
Why?
You didn't say one word to Mindy.
You didn't look in her direction the whole time.
Did you say anything to her?
You do that all the time.
I said hello, didn't I?
I don't think you did, honestly.
I think you were very caught up in Paul.
I'm such an asshole.
Yeah.
Did you even notice her?
Well, I smelled her perfume.
It's hard not to notice.
Bye, bye.
She didn't even wave goodbye or anything.
By the way, when the check comes tonight,
Stu can pick it up.
Don't pick up the check.
He runs to the bathroom every time the check comes.
I've noticed the bathroom trick.
No, you're not late, don't worry about it.
Good to see you.
We would've been here 10 minutes earlier if we'd valeted the car instead of trying to find a parking space.
I'm not gonna valet the car.
I got this new Cadillac CTS.
Drives like a dream.
I'm gonna give it to the valet?
Yeah, it's our third child.
Did you happen to run into the Reisers outside?
We saw them, but no eye contact.
No, they didn't see us.
They're not invited to the NRDC benefit at your house?
I don't think it would be a good idea, do you?
It just felt like it would be hypocritical.
It is a big undertaking.
But you know what?
I get to have Alanis Morissette singing in my living room.
Larry has no idea what we're talking about.
When you said Mr Duplicity,
You know who it's about?
Her guitar player.
No, it's a big secret.
She's never said.
It was an actor in a sitcom about a family.
Yeah, or I think I've heard her manager. But it's this huge secret.
She'll tell me.
People confide in me.
I'll find out.
I'm gonna find out the big secret.
Yeah, yeah, they moved out.
Yeah.
It's official.
I'm now full.
Now you are.
The Fat Boy's Special.
You're done?
I'll go to the little fat boy's room.
I know, okay.
He knows.
He knows.
Well, it was good to see you guys again.
It was great to see you.
I said don't pick up the check.
Well, last night was it, believe me.
All right,
I'm going out.
All right.
What will I do about Mindy Reiser?
I wish I could make it up to her.
People love when you ask them about what they're doing.
Next time you see her just be nice to her.
She thinks I'm the world's biggest schmuck.
Hey, Larry.
I got to talk to Cheryl.
Hey, Wanda, what's going on?
Are you okay?
Yeah, and no.
Okay.
There is going to be a terrorist attack this weekend in LA.
My brother told me, but I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
But you know, you my girl,
I had to tell you.
I'm going to Vegas with my boyfriend.
Attack, Larry.
Anthrax, a bomb, I don't know.
That's why they're not telling anybody.
We got to get out of here.
NRDC benefit that we've been working on for months.
Alanis Morissette is gonna be there.
I'm just, I'm thinking out loud.
Why don't we call the terrorists and ask them could they pick another weekend more suited for you?
Postpone the benefit, let's get out of here.
I thought I'd never say this, but Larry's right.
If we don't show up at the benefit,
Look, okay,
I did my part.
You're my friend,
I had to tell you.
I'm trying to help people, they're talking about a benefit.
Call me when you get back into town.
Hopefully you'll be here.
Wow.
Yeah, Larry.
I just don't see how we can leave this weekend.
This whole NRDC benefit was my idea.
I talked the Braudys into having it at their house.
Alanis Morissette is coming to sing.
I just know
I can't leave town.
I can go.
And where are you gonna go?
I could go golfing at Pebble Beach, maybe? that's a good idea?
It just seems like if we're gonna go,
But hopefully
Paul's not here.
I came actually to see you.
Do you have a few minutes?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty important.
What for?
But believe me, it's all true.
I have a friend who has a friend whose brother works in the CIA.
I haven't even spoken to him.
You have a contact in the government?
Mindy, your life is in danger.
Get out of here.
What kind of attack is it gonna be?
It could be anywhere.
Okay?
I have to call my sister.
No, no, no, you can't tell anybody.
I have to call my mother.
She's 80 years old.
She can't survive a terrorist attack.
You can't say anything, Mindy.
Okay, she lives in Orange County.
She's kind of far away.
They're not going to Orange County, the terrorists.
Maybe that will be good?
Palm Springs?
Palm Springs, why not?
It's 90 minutes, very nice.
Where do you stay when you're there?
Yeah.
Maybe we'll go there, or up north.
Santa Barbara is lovely this time of year.
Where are you and Cheryl going?
Unfortunately, we can't go.
NRDC event.
I know you and Cheryl don't have anything to do with it.
It's between us and the Braudys.
It's unbelievable.
Cheryl wanted to leave,
I thought it's best that we go to the benefit.
It's amazing.
I was driving around,
I saw your shop, I thought,
I've got to tell Mindy.
I have really misjudged you.
I can't thank you enough.
You are an amazing person.
I understand. Listen.
I want you to take these.
Give them to Cheryl, okay?
With my love.
Here you go.
She'll like these.
You'll like these.
This is aftershave.
Got you some of these samples.
What?
These are moisturizers from Mindy Reiser's shop.
Really? I wish I would've known you were going.
She carries that perfume
Wanda wears that I love.
Would've had you pick me up a bottle.
Why did you go there?
It's unusual, yes, highly unusual, yes.
Do you know anybody in the world?
I'll get it. Hello.
Hello?
Hey.
Yeah, pretty much.
I don't know. 90 percents.
Well, hey, come on.
Of course, no problem.
I'm happy to.
Yeah, okay.
Listen, I've been doing a lot of thinking,
No.
This is crazy, to hang around here. What for?
We are gonna stay right here.
Hi, Larry and Cheryl.
The party's in full swing.
Come on.
Are we the first ones here?
Where is everybody?
You'll notice Alanis Morissette is not here.
And guess who told Mindy?
Who?
This is exactly what Wanda said.
She said don't cause a panic, don't tell people.
Did we not have this discussion?
I felt bad because I snubbed Mindy at dinner the other night,
Told her there'd be a terrorist attack in Los Angeles this weekend?
There was supposed to be one.
Time after time. She opens her mouth.
You can't tell that woman anything.
Why do you think we don't talk to her?
And by the way, Larry, thank you for telling us about this terrorist attack.
That's really nice of you.
Why don't you call your friends, the Reisers?
Why don't you have a little bite with them?
Since you snubbed them and all, go ahead, all right?
I am going to bed.
Have a little bite with the Reisers.
At least they pick up a check every now and then.
You don't think I know about that bathroom trick?
The bathroom trick?
I got a problem, a medical problem.
Yeah, you got a problem paying money.
Mmm, very good.
I just want to know, for the restaurant.
Were you not listening when Wanda told you not to tell anybody?
She trusted you not to say anything to anyone.
Why in the world would you tell Mindy Reiser?
I was trying to get on her good side.
I guess what we should do is have it here.
What?
Reschedule the benefit and have it here.
Okay.
And I'll have to ask the Braudys to come over.
The Braudys? No, no, no.
They're not coming, forget it.
They went way over the line tonight.
Invite the Reisers, not the Braudys.
Invite the Reisers for spite.
This isn't a game, Larry.
Braudys freaking.
Everything's freaking with this guy.
He can't say the word fuck?
I can understand why they'd be upset, Larry.
Freaking asshole.
You don't gargle much, do you?
It's fun.
You should think about it.
You should think about how much money you just lost for the NRDC.
Nestle's makes the very best
Hey, Larry, how come you never told me?
I heard there was supposed to be a terrorist attack and you knew about it?
How come you never told me?
I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.
I wasn't supposed to.
My kids could've been wiped out.
They go to school.
We could've been killed, you know?
I'll tell you next time,
Let me call you back.
Larry, I can't believe that you knew there was a terrorist threat and didn't tell me.
Here we go with this again.
I've taken your laundry and dry cleaning.
I didn't tell a lot of people.
I only told one person.
It's not my fault,
I told one person.
Wanda is here, she's in the restroom.
She'll be out in a minute.
She'd like to speak with you.
Hey, big mouth.
What did I tell you, Larry?
Do you think this'll get me out of the dog house?
That's the one Wanda got.
That's it, yeah.
I hope it does the trick.
Paul and I spent the whole weekend in Palm Springs.
To pack up and leave like that.
Well, Larry, I know that you had the best of intentions.
But my God, it was a huge inconvenience for us.
I was just trying to save your life.
Yes, I know.
We drove three hours to the desert with the dog and the cats.
We ended up staying at a Super Eight motel.
I tried to be a nice guy,
I'm trying to save your life, and you have a terrible weekend on my account.
Larry, no, I understand.
It would've been nice if there was a small explosion, where nobody got hurt.
What happened with you?
How did the NRDC thing go?
Cause I didn't say anything,
Why would I say anything?
You told me not to.
Marty.
Larry, how are you?
Good. How's your show doing on the Comedy Central?
How do you do that voice?
I try and do it at home.
It's ranges that go high and then go very low.
Ranges that go high and then go very low.
It's not that at all.
Larry David.
You have that kind of flat New Yawk thing.
Well, let me try one more time.
High, and then low.
And then be stunned in the middle.
No, now you've had a stroke.
You know what?
I left her hanging in the store.
She's gonna be mad.
I'd love to teach you.
We may not even need this actually.
The acoustics are great in this house.
I'm acting like I'm not thrilled to be sitting here with you, but I am just out of my mind right now.
Me too, I've been urinating all day.
Really? That's the effect
I often have on people.
You've got to be kidding me?
They invited the Reisers and not us?
Thank you.
Thanks for coming over.
I can't wait for tonight.
Yeah, me too.
I'll see you guys.
Okay, see you later.
All right.
Hey, you gonna do,
You Oughta Know?
We can.
You want that one?
Yeah.
That would be good.
Yeah, nonstop for a while.
It's dying down a little bit, thank God.
You never tell anybody, huh?
Sure, I understand.
Ever want to unburden yourself,
I won't tell a soul
I won't even tell her.
You guys don't have pillow talk where you divulge things?
I haven't really told anyone.
I'll tell you.
But you can't tell anybody.
Don't worry,
I won't say a word.
I'll see you later.
What did I miss?
I'll make these guys a sandwich real quick.
Okay. Okay.
Why don't you guys come back here with me?
You were going a 1,000 miles an hour on the left side.
What is this, Australia?
This is a Cadillac, a CTS, a brand new car.
You're trying to sabotage the event, aren't you?
But this won't work now the way it once did
And I won't keep it up, even though I would love to
Once I know who I'm not, then I'll know who I am
But I know
I won't keep on
Playing the victim.
Mindy Reiser's been snubbing me all night.
I turned it around, and then I do it again.
It's called
You Oughta Know.
I want you to know
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.
Didn't think I was gonna find out, huh?
Is that what you thought?
If you were me, you wouldn't have found out cause you're stupid.
You guys are fucking stupid.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
Got a little greedy?
Here, you want the money?
Is that what you want?
You want money, you fucking idiots?
Here, take the money.
Here, go ahead.
Go ahead, take the fucking money.
You fucking idiots.
Take it, take it, take the fucking money.
Here, take it. Is that what you want?
Cut.
Larry?
I can't see the thing.
From what you could tell?
Every take I don't have enough money.
I think it's really developing very, very well, particularly the end.
What I'd like to get into more quickly
Let me take out
Gino's balls in a plastic bag.
Take it out of my pocket, hold up his balls.
The balls will never read.
They're not gonna read as well.
Balls will read.
Why won't balls read?
You got them in plastic?
But it's a little graphic for this.
What's the matter with you?
Do you know what you're doing?
Do you really know what you're doing?
This is just the threat of the violence, okay?
That's too hard.
Same slate. We get the energy better on the second take that way.
You know, Seinfeld, we did two takes and we were done.
We're just getting into it.
It's rich.
It's getting better and better every time you do it.
All right, try to watch this one, okay?
I was gonna watch, but I couldn't get away from the earphones.
I'm not gonna break it up.
All right.
No, what was he saying?
What was Martin Scorsese saying to you?
I don't know.
He has this little way of talking to me
I don't know, it's hard to tell.
But it's still early in LA.
I don't know why he hasn't called me back, you know?
My mother's sick.
He should call me back. I don't get it.
I know, I know.
It's hard to take anything you say seriously right now.
You just look crazy.
I don't know if we're going to make this plane. I really don't know.
He does too many takes.
All right, Marty, what's going on? We ready?
Come on.
It's kind of nice to be home, isn't it?
Honey, it's okay.
I think I want to stop by my father's on the way back.
You can take it back home.
Okay, just to check in?
Yeah, it's weird that he hasn't called me back.
I don't know what's going on.
Okay.
Listen, we're gonna make a stop first.
I'm gonna get dropped off.
Okay, that's good.
Very good. All right, honey. from the airport and Cheryl took it home.
Hey, I could've picked you up.
Look at this place.
Very nice.
Looks like you've been living here for a while.
I was busy, you know, I got busy.
What do you mean, you got busy?
What are you doing?
Let me make you a cup of coffee, huh?
Aw, I don't want any coffee.
I just came to check up on you.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I didn't expect you to come in today.
I really didn't know you were here.
Where's Mom?
Your mother, she got sicker and we had to bring her back to the hospital.
But we had to bring her back for a while.
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't even call.
She didn't want to bother you.
You know how she is.
She said,
Don't bother him.
He's in New York.
Let him enjoy himself.
She didn't want to spoil your trip.
Well, in a way.
She did warn me.
She said, If anything happens to me, don't bother Larry.
You're not gonna go on,
Dead, dead, she's dead.
And she didn't want me to bother you.
I'm not at the funeral?
What do you mean
Monday was the funeral?
Well, Monday was the funeral.
Why wasn't I at the funeral?
Why didn't you call me?
She told you not to bother me?
What is that supposed to mean?
You were in New York.
You give me a call.
You didn't call me? You didn't call me to tell me my mother died?
The last words she said to me,
If anything happens to me, you don't bother Larry.
Don't spoil his trip in New York.
That's insane.
The woman did not want to bother you.
I missed her funeral because she told you not to call me?
Who's that, Larry?
My condolences.
Heard you were in New York.
You missed a good one.
I may have been able to attend my mother's funeral.
Like a friend.
I noticed you called
Andy in New York, and he flew in.
Your mother didn't say not to call Andy.
She said not to call you, that's all she ever said.
Why didn't you call me when you were there?
It would have been nice if you called.
You know, I was busy, Andy.
I couldn't see you.
I'm not talking about that, just call me.
I figure if you're in town just call and say hello.
I didn't need to see you.
I didn't need to visit.
What's the difference?
I could call when I'm in LA.
Don't be a putz.
What are you talking about?
Are you out of your mind?
If you go to Florida, you're not gonna call Aunt Cher?
Not necessarily.
You come to town, you give me a call.
If I can't see you, there's no point in calling.
I didn't want to see you.
What is the matter with you?
Two people related to each other, two people, two cousins, and you're arguing this way?
Let me show you who was at this funeral.
Everybody was there, my goodness.
Your Uncle Harold was there.
He told his famous joke that he always tells.
Yeah, about the temple,
I know, I know.
Abe Lincoln, he's Jewish.
He got shot in the temple.
Yeah, we have a lot
And the eulogy was nice?
A lot of people turned out.
Who else called?
Michael Adler called.
I haven't spoken with this guy in five years.
What does he want to have lunch with me for?
I don't know.
Your suit is ready, which is actually good.
Is there anything worse?
Can you think of anything worse?
Go ahead, what else?
And the Mandels want to confirm dinner on Saturday.
Okay.
No, that's not happening.
Cancel it.
Okay.
Mary, hi, it's Cheryl David.
We're not gonna be able to do dinner on Saturday.
Larry's mother just passed away.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, bye bye.
What did she say?
Really?
Yeah, and she completely understood.
Huh.
Michael?
Larry David.
Pretty good.
I'd love to, but you know what?
My mom died.
Hi.
It's Larry David.
Hey, I'll bet Julie's pretty excited about that bat mitzvah, huh?
Unfortunately, we're not gonna be able to make it.
And mazeltov.
You too, darling.
Larry, how did you ever land this role in this film?
It's like unbelievable to me.
I'm happy for you, at the lmprov screaming at the audience one night in New York.
He remembered this?
He remembered because
I was having it out with this guy in the audience, and he thought
I could play this tough Jew.
I don't know, it was weird.
That's fucking unbelievable.
Maybe I should hang out by his house and scream and yell.
No, that's great.
Speaking of screaming and yelling,
I've never done it before, to meditate.
You know, I used to do it.
Did you know that?
What do you do, actually?
I had a mantra, you know, and you repeat this mantra in your head.
I have to sign up for a yoga class or a mantra class?
You could say anything you want.
Give yourself your own mantra.
You want a mantra?
I'll give you a mantra.
You want mine?
I'll give you mine.
What is your mantra?
Okay.
Ji ya?
What does it mean?
This guy, Ed Swindell.
He's spotted me.
He's gonna want
I got a lot of shopping to do. Have a blast.
Good to see you.
What a surprise.
Good place, isn't it?
Yeah, we're clothes shopping and I had to get out of there.
You know, little Deslys, the princess, she's holding up these two things.
Which makes me look
Jeez, bless your heart.
Our thoughts are with you.
Excuse me.
Yep?
I'm looking for my mother's grave,
Adele David.
She was just buried.
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's supposed to be right over there.
She got moved.
Special section.
What special section?
You'd better talk to the general manager.
Take a right here and it's the first building on the right.
My mother was moved to a special section?
Yes, evidently you were out of town.
Well, I would've been here, but I wasn't informed about it.
Okay, okay.
This is a horrendous mistake, okay?
Let me explain, please.
Tattoo?
My mother had a tattoo?
Yes, sir.
It's on the right cheek of her right buttock if you will.
My mother had a tattoo on her ass?
According to Leviticus,
You shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead, nor incise yourself.
Okay.
Look, I wasn't here.
I should've been here.
Sir, I'm here now and I'd like to rectify this.
I'd like to get her where she's supposed to be, where we paid for her plot.
There's nothing
I can do, sir.
The law is the law.
That's two things you didn't tell me.
What are we gonna do about this special section thing?
Well, that's true,
I don't understand this.
But they have this special section.
It's the stupidest, stupidest thing I ever heard of.
I have heard of it.
She would be sick to her stomach if she knew.
Yes, she would be upset.
Bottom line is, she'd be sick to her stomach.
When did she get this tattoo?
The tattoo?
We were just married.
We walked down the boardwalk over there.
She saw a tattoo parlor.
She said, Hey, let's do it.
Your parents had tattoos.
With our names.
A real show of love.
I can't imagine my parents making love.
I can't imagine you making love.
Wow. Well, that looks good.
Turkey.
It's all right, it's okay.
I'm gonna go check on that turkey.
Bad call, huh?
Having turkey for lunch?
Well, who knew?
I didn't know.
You doubled up.
What am I gonna do, order Chinese food in LA.?
You can't order
Chinese food in LA.?
There's no good
Chinese food in LA.
Right, 'cause all the good Chinese cooks went to New York.
A country of one billion people couldn't send one good chef to Los Angeles.
How can you possibly be arguing the quality of good Chinese food in LA. versus New York?
All right, fine.
You know what? come here, come here.
All right, here's my idea, okay?
I want to move her body.
I want to move the body to where it's supposed to be, because Mom would not want to be there.
It's not right.
I feel terrible about it.
I'm gonna try and pay off the gravedigger is what I'm gonna do.
Wow.
It's not dangerous because I don't have to do anything but pay off the gravedigger, that's all I have to do.
I think I can do it.
If he takes the money, fine, if not, well, at least I tried.
You think you can get this man to dig it up?
I got to tell you, we tried everything we could.
We talked to these people.
They would have none of it.
If you can pay this guy off,
I say go do it.
I'd like to contribute.
I'd like to contribute a few dollars.
You're not contributing.
I agree with you completely.
Yeah, who is it?
What's the matter, huh?
You're kidding.
No, I'm getting into this and it's starting to work.
I just forgot to turn the phone off.
What about the mantra?
It's good, by the way. It's working.
I could get it back.
Get it back?
What is that? You gave it to me?
I changed my mind.
I'd like to get it back.
You can't be
Well, I had it first, kind of, you know.
You did, but you let me have it.
Now it's part of my whole being.
My essence screams of this mantra.
Splitting it? What is this, a timeshare in the Hamptons? homosexual.
You don't have to tell me.
I know I'm not a homosexual.
I know, but I'm really having a difficult time giving it back.
I mean, you did a nice turn and you know, and now you're reneging, you know?
It's just that, you know, my mother just died.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't even think twice about it, all right?
Who's that?
Good night, honey.
Good night?
Really, good night?
Good night.
No, no, please.
Honey, I just showered.
I don't feel like getting into all that right now.
Hey.
How you doing?
Remember me?
All right.
Meet me at the grave.
All these stones look alike.
Completely, completely lost.
Watch your feet.
Hey.
Hey.
You're late.
Yeah, well, we got kind of lost.
Welcome to the special section.
Thank you.
Hey, what about you?
I only got four shovels.
Asshole.
All right.
Ji ya.
Ji ya.
Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya,
I made it out of clay
No. Happy?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ji ya?
What, what?
I found out what it meant from some chick who does this meditation stuff. and take that mantra and shove it up your ass.
Fuck me.
Fuck me.
Fuck you.
Hmm.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Hi.
Can we come in and talk to you please?
We're looking for a Larry David, maam. Can you help us?
Well, I'm wondering what this is about.
We need to speak with him, maam.
Hey, that's him, that's the guy.
Mr David? We're gonna need you to come with us, sir.
What are you talking about?
Counterfeit bills, sir.
Yeah, that's right.
Counterfeit bills.
I know what happened here.
I was in this movie, and they gave me this counterfeit money.
No, but I'll give you real money.
Ji ya.
Larry David?
Hi, Phil Dunlap, here for the chef's position.
Hi.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Yeah.
Yeah. Hey, look at you. Look at you.
Yeah, look at you.
Wow. When did you start losing it?
I started losing when I was 15. 15, wow, earlier than me, yeah.
Yeah, a little bit earlier.
I actually like it.
Ah, yeah, me too.
A little sunscreen on it and it's fine.
You can't go outside without the sunscreen.
That's what they do, these guys with the hats, don't they?
They wear it all the time, and they'll meet a girl then they'll show up on a date.
Are they gonna take the hat off?
Wear it?
Then the girl is gonna be, like,
I didn't know you were bald.
You're a liar.
Right, yeah.
No.
Psychologically wrong with them, what about the transplant people?
Exactly.
I'm surprised Hitler didn't round up the toupee people.
If I'm going to be a sick megalomaniac, to round up people who I hated, they would be on my list.
I'd have my henchmen going around tugging at people's hair.
Balden, come with me.
Ach, Balden.
My fault.
It was my fault the whole time.
No, no, no, it was my fault.
We were all crazy.
Forget it.
You know what?
To new times, good friends.
Good, good.
It's good to see you guys.
Does that bother anybody when I make a noise like that?
Is anybody disturbed by that?
And why should you be?
How is everything going?
How are the kids? How's the house?
Jakey is driving us nuts.
He's always wanted a dog, and we kept putting him off.
He wants a dog, and we can't put him off anymore.
No freaking puppy, though.
I don't want the peeing,
I don't want the chewing.
I want a good, smart, trained dog.
Jeff's got that
How old is the dog?
He's, I don't know, maybe four.
I had a German shepherd when I was a little boy.
They got it from the fire department.
A what?
I'm telling you, this is an amazing dog.
Oscar?
Oscar.
Jeff and his wife.
Now they reconciled and he's moved back, but he's allergic to the dog, and he's sniffing and sneezing all the time,
And he's a wreck.
Great, they have a little girl.
Tough customer.
But the dog is fabulous with her.
You know what?
How do we do this, how do we do this?
All right, you're interested?
He's like an elephant sticking his head in a pond.
Why are you watching this?
Stop it.
The cork is dry.
We need to send this back.
You can't send this back.
You're an expert in wine?
Go ahead, taste it.
Larry, come on.
At $140 a bottle,
I don't want fine.
No, Larry, Larry, come on, you can't.
You don't have to drink it.
Didn't I say last time we were here
I'm not allowed to talk about it.
She doesn't like it.
She's bored with restaurant talk.
When I was on Seinfeld I wasn't allowed to talk about Seinfeld.
I'm not allowed to talk about anything I'm doing.
We're opening next week.
This new chef we got, he's gonna be fantastic.
Great.
Where did you find him?
Okay, Larry only likes him because he's bald.
What makes you say that, Cheryl?
He told me. He goes, I found this guy, he's great.
He's bald.
Does that seem logical?
And only because he's bald.
No, no, no splitting.
No splitting.
You picked up the last one.
Yeah, I got to go to the bathroom, right.
Go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom.
Thank you, Stu.
Anyway, thanks Stu, that's very nice of you.
My pleasure.
You're welcome.
What about me?
You gonna thank me too?
Well, you can call it our money, but for the sake of discussion, he's the one who goes to work and earns the money.
Cheryl, you don't work for yourself.
She didn't work,
I earned the money.
It's not about where it's coming from, it's what it becomes.
It's completely about where it's coming from.
That's what it's about,
Where does it come from?
Well, I must say that I am just glad that in my marriage, that's not an issue.
It's not an issue in our marriage either.
It's just a fact of where the money came from.
This is nice.
Hey, you know me,
I think you know me well enough to know that by now.
How come there's no partitions in the bathroom between the urinals?
I don't know.
I thought we were gonna have that.
Is it important?
It looks nice now.
We want a little pee privacy, do we not?
Yeah, privacy.
This isn't a bus station.
What do you think?
This is not gonna be that kind of crowd. restaurant, Larry.
Still people go off to the side.
They've got the 45? angle things.
But is it really important, Larry?
Yes, Michael.
It is important, yes.
We can't get it in time.
We open in three days.
Hey, everybody.
My family's dog, not my dog.
This dog kills me,
If you're allergic, why do you have the dog?
My wife and I were separated for a while.
While we were separated, she got this dog.
Now I'm back and the dog ain't going anywhere.
I want to talk to you about that.
Oscar.
What's wrong with it?
What are you doing,
Oscar?
What's he got?
No, that floor is spotless for the health inspection.
Isn't he
Well, folks, this rescue canine
I think there's a real strong possibility there's a dead body underneath that floor.
How long will that take?
I'm telling you, I'm gonna take my money out of this place.
What if there's a dead body under there?
We're fucked.
No one will ever come to the restaurant where they found a body.
It'll be in the papers. We're fucked.
If there's a dead body underneath there, we are fucked.
I can't live with this dog, it's making me crazy.
I am highly allergic to dogs.
You know the Braudys?
That guy who smashed into Alanis Morissette?
We had dinner with them the other night.
They're looking for a dog for the kids.
I mentioned Oscar.
They would take that dog off your hands tomorrow.
My daughter's in love with that dog.
What do I do?
You've got to sit down and talk to her.
Tell her Daddy can't live in this house because the dog makes Daddy sick.
She'll understand, don't you think?
Yeah, I think she would.
Explain it to her, what's going on.
Look at that, he came.
I can't believe it.
You really love Oscar.
You don't get the opportunity that often, you know?
Good boy.
Daddy doesn't feel good.
Sneezing, up all night.
It hurts right here.
I have a horrible, horrible pain.
My eyes are watering and I feel horrible.
And the reason this is all happening is because of your pal Oscar.
Daddy or Oscar.
What I'm saying is, if you say Oscar,
But you're choosing Oscar.
I'm your dad.
I just love that dog.
I have to go to the bathroom.
We open in three days.
This is ridiculous.
We shouldn't have called the cops.
We shouldn't have brought the dog here in the first place.
What's going on?
Wait a second, wait a second, hold on.
What does he got there?
A bra?
Is that it?
Is there more?
Is there a body with it?
Nothing else down here.
That's it.
That's it? a bra?
That's it folks.
He's a good
How long is it gonna take to get all this back?
With what you got going on here, it's a mess.
That's on the safe side.
Blessing in disguise.
Larry.
A dog.
She chose a fucking dog over her own father.
You sat down, you laid it out?
I told her,
Daddy's sick.
He can't stay in the same house with Oscar.
She wants Oscar.
She wants the dog.
They took him back to your house.
My house?
No, no, his house.
His house. I'm at the W. Hotel.
It's his house now.
By the way, he turned up a bra today.
There's no corpse.
A bra?
What the fuck's wrong with that dog?
He's closing us down for three weeks now.
I got to call that bald chef and tell him.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Fuck.
My mommy's next door.
Anyway,
I actually came to talk to you.
Oh.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna have this instead.
Okay.
I just want to try this wine.
Believe me, I know as much about this as the next guy.
Come on.
No.
Too fruity.
And a tad on the oaky side.
What does oaky mean?
It tastes a little like a tree.
Let's talk about your dad, okay?
Isn't there another animal we could interest you in?
Perhaps a little pussycat?
I don't like cats.
How about a rabbit?
I never heard of a little girl that didn't want a pony.
Hamster?
Put him in a cage and you can torture him a little bit.
It's not boring if you torture them.
I like Oscar better.
What is that, that dog whistle?
Is that
Oscar's whistle?
I saw your daddy use it the other day.
He came running out of the restaurant.
I don't understand how this thing works.
Where's the whistle part?
What do you say?
I don't want Oscar.
I want Daddy.
Go home.
It's all taken care of.
That's right.
We had a little chat.
I'm taking him to the Braudys.
He's sitting right next to me.
You're more than welcome.
All right, my friend.
Goodbye.
Huh?
What do you say,
We're going to the Braudys, you excited?
Are you excited about the Braudys?
Come here, give me a kiss.
Give Uncle Larry a kissy,
Oscar boy.
Ooh.
All right, look at your new home.
You're such a good boy.
Yeah, you're such a good boy.
Well, here's Oscar.
I was telling you about.
Yeah, all yours.
Yeah, congratulations.
No, I mean, do you have anything else to say to me from dinner?
I enjoyed the chicken very much.
I was surprised at how good it was, actually.
Very funny, that's very funny.
Look, I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but you know how I feel about what happened at dinner.
Larry, I'm waiting,
I'm just waiting.
I'm still waiting.
I guess you'll have to continue to wait if it's a thank you that you're waiting for.
Because a thank you is just a little more than you can handle.
No, it's not more than I can handle.
If you had paid for the meal,
I would've thanked you as I told you.
Okay.
Extraordinary.
It's extraordinary.
Is this what you're saying to me?
If you want to thank me for dinner, I will look at your dog.
I thank people when they deserve to be thanked.
In this particular instance, you do not deserve to be thanked.
Because you haven't worked a day since you got out of college.
Leave the doggie alone.
He's not our dog.
I wanted to give this dog to you, but your mommy doesn't want it.
Don't be silly, you weren't gonna give him to me.
Why look for one when there's one right here?
Yeah.
Okay, okay, all right.
Hey, hey what do you say?
He sleeps on my bed.
You sick fuck,
Larry David.
What the fuck do you think you're doing getting my kid drunk?
Drunk?
What are you talking about?
Do I look like a fucking idiot, that I'm gonna believe you?
You got her drunk and stole the fucking dog, all right?
No, she told me
I could have the dog.
All liquored up.
I thought she had a speech impediment.
You've known the kid since she was born, and she suddenly develops a speech impediment?
She's at home hysterical that her dog is gone.
I don't know what you did to him.
Get me the fucking dog.
I just want to thank you for dinner the other night.
I don't know what got into me.
You're married, you're a couple. of course you get thanked.
That has nothing to do with it.
You're a housewife, you raise the kids.
You've got kids, that's a full time job.
You deserve a thank you.
And I was dead wrong.
Thank you.
That wasn't easy to do and I really do appreciate it.
You know what?
Once I realized the situation and how wrong I was, it was easy to do.
I am impressed.
I didn't expect it.
I just didn't, but thank you.
Good, good.
Whew.
How's the dog working out?
The dog is actually great.
They're loving him, he's sweet as can be.
He's terrific.
I just left her, and her kid's pretty broken up about it.
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Well, it's a long story, but when her daughter told me I could have the dog, she was quite drunk at the time, unbeknownst to me. when she said
And as long as I'm here,
I'll take the dog.
As long as you happen to be here, you'll take the dog back?
I really need it.
I mean, she wants the dog back.
It's her dog, it is her dog.
It's not her dog anymore,
Larry, because you brought it here.
You know what?
It's not going to happen.
Oskie.
No, I am not.
I'm not giving you my dog.
You're really gonna disappoint a little girl.
Well, Larry, go back and tell her to have another drink.
Because she's not getting her dog back, okay?
I take back my thank you, by the way.
The one that you never actually gave me anyway.
Okay, bye, Larry.
Bye bye, now.
Bye bye, now.
You can leave now.
You can do it right now because I will be calling the police.
Go, bye bye.
I have to go walk my dog.
Then I'm gonna have him do a little fetching for me.
We might hop into the pool.
Bye, Larry.
Keep going, leave.
Oscar.
Larry, you piece of shit.
Thank you, thank you very much.
What's going on?
Why'd you bring
That's not bad at all.
I got a matching earring too, right there.
That's nice, right?
That says true love right there.
Now, I ain't into rapping too much, but when it pays for rocks like these, you got it.
Excuse me for one second.
Larry? Larry?
Larry.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Stepping on some packing bubbles.
I know, but why are you doing that?
Because it makes a fun kind of popping noise.
It's fun.
Why aren't you mixing in with people? Mingling?
You know what?
I'm gonna get going, I think.
I got to pick up a script at Jeff's house.
Jeff's house?
I thought he was staying in a hotel.
No, they bought a new house.
It's right in the neighborhood.
What about the dog? What happened?
Just stay for 10 more minutes, okay?
All right, fine.
I'm gonna run to the restroom,
I'll meet you back.
I'm all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I write my own lyrics and shit, you know what I mean?
Check this shit out.
It's called I'm Coming to Get You.
Opening your fucking trap and flapping your lip?
Don't fuck with me, nigga, or you're gonna get dropped,
Rice Krispies thing, yeah.
If you say anything, you'll beg me to die,
Cause I'll make you suck my dick, then I'll nut in your eye.
I'll stomp on your world as if my name was Godzilla,
I'm coming for you, motherfucker,
You know?
I like it.
I got one tiny little comment.
What, what, what?
I would lose the motherfucker at the end, cause you already said fuck once, you don't need two fucks.
You already got the one fuck.
I would change the motherfucker to bitch.
Yeah, that's right, player, that's right.
I like that shit.
Yeah, I like you, motherfucker.
Don't hit me.
Yeah, yeah. Check it out.
You like eating pussy?
I like it, I like it, but I'm a little too lazy to do it, you know?
It hurts my neck.
It hurts my neck.
Asian pussy. you're getting married.
Wanda's, you know, you can't do that anymore.
No, I have to do that, motherfucker.
You know what I'm saying?
I have to eat the pussy.
You got Wanda now.
You can't do it. Wanda's gonna find out.
Wanda ain't gonna find out shit.
You my nigga, right?
This is between me and you.
She ain't she gonna find out, is she?
I got to take off.
I got to pick up a script at my friend's house.
All right, nice to see you.
Yeah, yeah.
Good to be in the neighborhood.
Look at this.
I just go where the wife tells me to go.
Yeah, well, don't we all?
Look at this place.
I'll give you the tour.
You know what? that's okay.
I see it, it's beautiful, it's great.
You don't want a tour?
Get the fuck out of my house, okay?
Get the fuck out right now.
All right, fine,
I'll take the house tour.
No, no, I'm done,
I'm over it.
I'm turned off.
Leave.
Get the fuck out, okay?
Freak of fucking nature, doesn't want a house tour.
Susie, I'll take the house tour.
No, no.
No tour for you.
We'll have lunch tomorrow, don't forget.
Okay, lunch tomorrow.
Well, what'd you think of that party?
That was fun, wasn't it?
Fun? I don't know.
Was it fun?
It was very fun.
Yeah, we had a nice little conversation.
Quite a character.
Loves the ladies.
Yeah, he really gets around.
I mean, everybody knows.
Everybody knows?
You're kidding.
That's not how he presented it to me.
Well, what do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean, everybody knows that he likes to flirt with the women.
Why?
What was he telling you?
What did he tell you?
Was he telling you about women?
Is he fooling around on Wanda?
You're gonna what?
He told you he's fooling around with other women.
But you're not gonna call
Wanda now?
Of course I am.
She's engaged to him.
I don't care.
He'll blame me. You can't do that.
You know what he's gonna do?
Have you heard his lyrics?
Huh?
If you betray me, you're gonna die?
You'll suck on my dick,
I'll put a nut in your eye?
This is real life, okay?
I understand.
You want to tell her, go ahead.
I will be in Antarctica.
That's how far away
You're that scared that you'd flee the country?
Yeah, I am, yes, I am.
I want to live,
I want to have both legs.
I want to have my penis, all right, and my testicles intact.
This is her life, okay?
This is my life and I'd like to live it by not going into handicapped parking.
Hey, tomorrow, the reshoot for the Scorsese movie.
You're all hip to it?
You're good?
The wardrobe people wanted you to bring the jacket. with blue stitching.
She left a message on the machine, I got it.
All right, good. I don't want to make a big deal about this.
It wouldn't have killed you to have taken the house tour.
I feel very queer taking house tours.
Queer?
All right, you know what?
Hey, look at that closet.
Nice beams up there.
I like those beams.
What's the name of that architect?
Good coffee.
It is good coffee.
Pretend this is a commercial.
Watch me do this as a commercial, okay?
Boy, that's really good coffee.
Cheryl.
What?
What?
God damn it.
What is up with the bubbles?
Take it easy.
What are you screaming about?
I'm tired of listening to these things pop all over.
I just found these.
I'll pop 'em today and be done with it.
You threw it away?
What do you mean you threw it away?
You're weren't gonna wear it.
It had a hole in it. It's hideous.
Of course it had a hole in it, that's where I got shot.
I need it for the reshoot.
I didn't know you were gonna need it.
Do you know what this means?
I think it was from Mitchell's.
I saw the tag,
Okay.
That's not working.
I can't believe you still had this thing.
I desperately needed this to do this reshoot on this movie.
Well, great, you're in luck.
Here, I'll take it.
Okay, I kind of like this thing.
Let me see, it might not fit.
Is that it?
You don't have any more?
I'll tell you what,
I'll fold that up for you
Actually, I kind of need to take care of it.
It's not that complicated.
I can do it.
It's not that complicated?
Actually, it is a little complicated.
Okay, thank you.
You're stretching it out now.
It's not a scoop neck,
I've got it.
All right, well,
Well, you weren't helping me out.
I never could have done that.
Actually, I'm gonna ask you to leave.
I don't need to be insulted in my own store.
I'm gonna ask you to leave, okay?
I don't think you're going to take the jacket.
Have a nice day. I don't like to be insulted in my own store.
Hey, you insulted me, I didn't insult you. I was trying to help you.
How many people come in here and fold a sweater?
I'm considerate enough to do it.
It's not an issue of consideration.
Actually, you're insulting me, that's why you're not getting the jacket.
I wasn't insulting you,
I was trying to help you.
Trying to help me by making extra work for me. Thanks a lot.
Come on, I'll just give you the credit card.
You're not gonna buy the jacket.
I'm not being an asshole.
You're being an asshole, that's why I'd like you to leave, okay? Thank you.
Thanks a lot, have a good day.
And by the way, don't try to send any friends in here to buy the jacket, cause I'm not selling it to anyone.
You think I'd send anybody to this piece of shit store?
I have to tell you. cheating on you.
What?
How do you know?
Larry told me.
I'm gonna kick his ass.
Are you gonna tell him that Larry told you?
You goddamn right I am.
Yeah, that's the last name.
There might be a hyphen in that.
Well, Krazee, I guess is the first name, unless the whole last name
What about an H at the end of Killa?
Did you try that?
What about the Z?
Is that possible?
No, no, that's an optometry place.
Okay, all right, thank you.
Where's my nigga?
Where's my nigga?
There's my motherfucking nigga right there.
Get your ass in here.
All right.
God damn.
You came to see my motherfucking shit, didn't you?
I'm supposed to meet
Cheryl and Wanda.
Do you have any idea where they went?
Hey, hey, what's up man?
Where you going?
You just got here, nigga.
Don't you want a tour of the house?
You want a tour of the house, don't you?
You want a tour?
Come on motherfucker, come on.
Yeah, that's right. Come on, yeah,
Okay, yeah. See this shit, this is the dining room, you know?
You got some chairs and shit.
You know what I mean?
We got the floor, you know what I mean?
Got four of these motherfuckers.
I wanted three, but I was like, four is better.
We got rooms all over this motherfucker.
You know what I mean?
Yo, check it.
You like this shit?
The Oriental room and shit?
All the shit go down right there.
The bed's a lot smaller than I would have thought.
Maybe I will get a bigger bed.
I can have three or four motherfuckers in there.
Know what I'm saying?
A whole harem of motherfuckers.
You got to have three or four motherfuckers in there.
You are a pimp.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You got a garbage can?
No, you can throw that shit anywhere.
Go ahead, throw it.
Toss the motherfucker.
See?
There you go.
Watch this shit.
Yo, Delicious.
Delicious.
Tell Matilda to come in here and clean this shit up.
And bring me an Aliz?
No, thank you.
What's up?
What?
I have the exact same jacket.
But I mean,
Hey, it's cool, man.
You all excited and shit.
You want to try it on?
Go try it on, I don't give a shit.
No, but this is unbelievable because I lost the jacket.
Try the fucking jacket on, man.
Holy shit, I can't even believe this.
I'm thinking about putting a plasma screen on the fucking ceiling and have Scarface
Fuck it, I don't need it.
I got plenty of shit right here.
This is unbelievable.
You don't have to say shit.
We roll like that, you know what I mean?
You know what?
Honest to God.
I love the crib, it's fantastic.
You know what?
My wife's gonna kick my ass.
I know how that shit is.
Don't let her fuck with you.
Yo, Delicious.
Get a tissue, my man's gonna sneeze.
Delicious.
Hey.
Hi, Barbara.
What are you doing here?
Just came to see you, you know.
Hey, Larry.
How did you know we were here? and he told me.
Do you know he's cheating on me?
Cheating. I know.
He's fucking around, Larry.
My husband is dead and I wouldn't fuck around.
Did you interrupt those bunch of sluts up there and everything?
A big fuckfest going on, Larry?
No, no fuckfest.
Just Delicious, that's all.
He's cheating on me, Larry.
Have you told him yet that you know?
No, but I'm going to. I'm gonna tell him that and a few other things.
When he asks you how you know, what are you gonna say?
I'm gonna tell him I heard.
Heard from who?
What difference does it make?
Why do you give a shit?
For that wrong person.
I don't give a fuck about the wrong person.
No, you got to care about the wrong person.
The wrong person is an innocent person.
He's the wrong person for cheating on me, all right?
That's the wrong motherfucker right there, okay?
Maybe we should dance.
You want to dance?
Yeah, I don't want to.
I can't right now.
I can't.
Thank you.
Fuck this, I'm going over there now.
Don't tell him who told you and just kick his ass.
My friend
He thinks he can just eating pussy left and right?
I'm out of here.
Wait, wait, wait.
Why wouldn't you dance with me?
I didn't want to upset the widow.
What about upsetting your wife, for one dance?
Have you ever seen the look on a widow's face when couples are dancing?
They're with a friend, then all of a sudden
I think just one dance she would've been okay.
You're really drunk, aren't you?
I have a question.
Yeah, I got a couple of questions myself.
The David promise.
I didn't tell her.
Yeah, a David promise is worthless.
I have a question. What did you tell
What did you say?
What did you say?
I just can't even believe that.
Yeah, what is he talking to Wanda about that for?
We were having a private conversation.
What did Wanda tell you?
What did you tell
I'm just curious.
You don't want to do it?
What was I supposed to do?
Say it's inappropriate?
Holy shit, what is that?
Who's that?
It's Killa.
Hold on a second.
Come on.
Hey, where's Larry at?
Get your ass down here.
Hey, Larry.
Hey, what the fuck?
Motherfucker, what the fuck?
Motherfucker, what the fuck?
You fine, you know that?
Krazee.
How you gonna throw the jacket at me, motherfucker?
How you gonna throw the jacket at me?
I thought you were my nigga.
You ain't my nigga.
I have no jacket for tomorrow, that's great.
Hey, Larry.
Hi, how are you?
Good. Joe, good to see you.
Listen, you know,
I lived here for a while, but I was asked to leave.
I don't have the jacket for the scene, you know?
The window box designs.
You don't have it?
Your wife threw it out?
Excuse me, but how did your wife get the jacket?
The thing is, obviously
I can't reshoot the whole scene.
It's okay, Marty.
Perfect, okay, here we are, beautiful, perfect. Thank you, thank you. How did this get here? for all my wardrobe.
It's part of my wardrobe. You're not supposed to take any wardrobe home.
You took it home.
I wanted you to bring it back.
Thank you, Wendy, thank you, thank you.
All right, we got the jacket, that's it.
Do you know the aggravation this woman caused me?
Well, then she gave me the impression that was the only jacket.
I was in possession of the only jacket.
We got the jacket, let's forget it.
We go, we go. That's it.
Why did she put it in with my stuff?
He's gonna kill me, this guy.
Unbelievable. What does he mean, she gave him the jacket
Which way? Do I make a left over here?
Yeah, just down the corner to the left.
How many more scenes do we have with him?
You should've seen that cocksucker's face when I took out that knife.
He said to me, he said, You don't got no call. lmagine that?
You don't got no call?
I got call today,
And I'll have call tomorrow.
Good.
Hey, listen, is this true?
Did I hear that you were at the U2 concert last night?
I got to tell you, man,
It's a little embarrassing to me.
Don't be embarrassed.
You like to rock and roll.
How'd you know
I was at the U2 concert?
Well, you know Marge, at the front.
She called to confirm your appointment, your housekeeper told her that you had been there.
My housekeeper told Marge
I was at the U2 concert?
Yeah. I didn't know you were into the rock and roll thing.
I'm not. You know,
I don't like the idea that everything I do people are finding out about through my housekeeper, that's all.
Hey, I don't know what else you did yesterday.
That's the only thing
I know about yesterday.
Well, don't mention to anybody that I was at the U2 concert,
Let's move past that.
What do we got going on here?
I got a pubic hair.
You got a pubic hair in your throat?
Well, let's take a look at it then.
That's not that unusual.
I got people in here all the time with stuff stuck in their throat.
You know what?
Don't even need to know the schedule.
Up, open for me.
There it is.
Yeah, I see it.
I see it back there.
I'll tell you now, it's gonna be a little painful for you.
It's gonna hurt.
Frankly, it's gonna hurt.
Three days at the most.
Jesus, it's stuck in there and it's scratching me.
I just feel like I can get it up but I can't.
I know, your choice.
Happy to go in and get it if you'd like.
Or you can let it come on out by itself.
What do you think? stay away from that for a couple of days.
Don't worry. I'll be staying away from it for a while.
Very good.
All right, always good to see you.
How did your doctor's appointment go?
I got about another two days with this thing.
He looked at it and says it will go away by itself.
Listen, Larry, we have a lot to do before my parents get here.
What?
What's there to do?
We need to do all their Christmas shopping, and we need to get a Christmas tree.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
What are you saying?
Christmas tree?
Yeah, we're gonna pick out a Christmas tree and have it set up.
We're getting a Christmas tree?
My parents are coming.
We're celebrating Christmas.
Is that a surprise to you?
Give me a break on the tree.
Do we have to do that?
Of course we do.
It's Christmas.
It's too weird, man.
Come on, that is just too weird.
No, listen, man, you're gonna like it.
I'm a Jew. To have a tree in the house, it's bad luck.
He might not understand.
Did you tip anybody yet for Christmas?
Then I got to go get Jeff, we're gonna go to the club and tip everybody there.
There's no end to it with this holiday.
But you know what?
It's gonna make you feel good.
All right,
I'll see you later, okay?
Hey, Dora?
Could you do me a favor, okay?
When people call and ask for me, could you please just not tell them where I am? and you told them
I went to a U2 concert, you know?
I don't like people knowing where I go.
You too.
How's the gardening?
Usted eres muy amable.
Very kind.
You know what?
You can use the t? form with me.
Informal t?, between us, we don't need usted.
T?, yo.
U2 concert.
Do you know anyone in the band?
Well, yeah, I know the lead singer.
You got to pronounce it.
I don't know how to pronounce it.
But, you know what?
Because you spelled it, it's a draw.
I don't owe you anything.
Dora.
I called the house and she told me.
That is unbelievable.
I just spoke to her about that.
My doctor knows, now you know.
She told the doctor the same thing.
Well, you need to talk with your maid.
Well, if you come over my house in a couple of days, you'll see a
Christmas tree there.
Why?
Cheryl's parents are coming.
She wants a tree.
Nothing worse than Jews with trees.
They can't let them have their holiday.
We have to horn in on their holiday.
They can't just let them have their holiday.
Listen to me, listen to me.
Susie's on her way up right now, okay?
A couple weeks ago, she went out of town,
Okay? Nothing going on.
But she found the phone bill.
I told her it was you, okay?
I said you got in a fight with Cheryl, you slept over, and then you made the phone call, okay?
How come you didn't tell her the truth? for platonic friends. it gets weird.
I didn't know you were here.
What the fuck is your problem?
What's the matter with him?
What are you doing?
What was that about?
I was calling my housekeeper Dora.
Wait a minute.
You have a fight with Cheryl, you call your housekeeper?
Yeah. She was gonna quit, it was a whole huge thing.
She's having big problems with Cheryl.
Cheryl can't find anything.
She couldn't find her pajamas.
I had to talk her out of quitting.
Larry?
She was quitting the next day.
I had to, yeah.
You're lying, or you're lying.
One of you two assholes is lying, I just don't know which one.
I don't believe you.
Please, I have things to do, okay?
Merry Christmas.
A merry Christmas to you, my friend.
Thank you for everything.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.
Very nice.
It felt good, they're all happy.
What's the matter?
I think I tipped that guy twice.
I'm not sure about that.
You know what?
I was just going around tipping everybody,
Yeah, 'cause
I got confused.
Cause he makes twice as much money.
What do you mean, why?
Hi.
Yeah, well, that was very nice.
You're very welcome, but I'm sure you're not aware of this, but I think I inadvertently tipped you twice.
Twice?
No, no, you came up and you said
I'm sure you didn't realize it.
No, I would have realized it, if it had happened.
I only tipped you once?
Yes.
Do you want your first tip back?
I'd like my second tip back.
There was no second tip.
Hmm.
You've got your gold triangle.
You're here.
What do you think, you like it?
It's like, the biggest thing
I've ever seen.
The bigger the better.
Cheryl's in the kitchen, by the way, with Becky.
Yeah, they're baking.
What'd you get Cheryl?
You can tell me.
You know what? I think I'm gonna give her my grandfather's tallis.
She loves scarves.
Is that all?
Yeah.
Grape stem.
Honey, why can't you wear the scarf that Dora gave you for your birthday?
You know, the red one?
Because it itches me.
It's itchy.
Well, she brought it up to me today.
She just feels like you don't care that she gave you this lovely present.
Then she told me that you yelled at her for telling people where you go.
I didn't yell at her, we had a talk, because my doctor had heard that I went to the U2 concert.
You went to the U2 concert?
Okay. And listen, she's upset because you tipped Carlos twice as much as you tipped her.
What, are you crazy?
I didn't do that.
I didn't know who to tip and who not.
I forgot who I tipped,
You should take her to lunch at the club.
That is a really good idea.
Treat her to a very nice lunch.
Everything she says you go along with?
I would like it if you took me to lunch is all I'm saying.
You can disagree with her once.
She happens to think that I'm right most of the time.
Do you really think
Okay.
I'll take her to lunch.
I think that's wonderful.
Did you tell Dora that you got a bigger
Christmas bonus than her?
No.
Cause she told my wife that you said that.
No, se?or.
No s?
Don't you find that curious?
No, se?or.
You know what I love?
You're a good folder.
Very good folder.
Particularly
Okay.
I see that,
I notice the folding.
Okay, let's discuss the toilet paper.
I am never in that bathroom looking at cardboard.
I'm never running out of there with my pants at my ankles screaming, More toilet paper.
You know?
What else, what else do you do?
Okay, Mr Larry.
Okay.
Se?orita, algo m?s?
No, gracias.
Muy amable.
Oye, ? qu? haces con el viejo este, eh?
Pues ah? trabajo en su casa, f?jense.
No, claro que no.
Mira, si te regala algo,
Hi, Lar.
Hi, Larry.
All right. I made a mistake,
I know, but I thought you were talking to a woman.
I don't know why
Cheryl doesn't like you.
I'm sure it has nothing to do with your work.
Is this the best coincidence?
What are the odds? This is unbelievable.
I can't believe it.
You are hungry?
We'll get Daddy.
Is it the sponge thing?
O come, all ye faithful
O come ye,
O come ye
To Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Yea Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
We got them off the Internet, Larry.
They're a little different.
How much longer do you think the caroling's gonna go on tonight?
Larry, can I see you for a second?
Sure.
O come let us adore Him
And I told Susie that you and Jeff are full of shit.
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down
His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little
Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay.
Larry.
The cookies from last night?
What?
You ate them?
They were for the manger scene.
You ate the baby Jesus and his mother Mary.
I thought he was a monkey.
The toasted coconut was hay.
The barn?
I thought that was all part of the zoo.
You know what?
I'll make it up to you.
How are you gonna make it up to us?
Nothing's open.
It's Christmas.
Okay, we're going to go visit our cousin.
You'd better look into that.
You lying piece of shit.
Out of my house. on that goddamn Larry David,
I'll kill him.
I know you have traveled far.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hello.
Hi.
Let me ask you a question.
Renting? We're a volunteer group with the church.
It's Christmas Day, we have no manger scene.
We don't have a Nativity scene in my house. We had one, but I ate it.
Just for a couple of hours.
We could probably see our way to your home.
Well, we'd have to maybe discuss the donation.
Whatever you think is fair.
What do you think is fair?
And a meal of course, because we're about to have a lunch.
I don't really cook.
That's fine.
Okay, $500, fine.
I'll give you $500.
And the meal.
I don't mean to push.
Okay.
Which one are you?
Pleasure.
That would be Mary of course, the Mother of God.
Okay, great.
You can put all this junk on a trailer?
It's not junk, but we do put it in the trailer.
It all fits in there.
It's very convenient.
Beautiful.
Well, this is fantastic.
I was in a bind, and you really helped me out, Joseph.
I'm glad I could do that.
It's a pleasure.
Boy, that was fast.
Yes, well, the excellent directions didn't hurt.
Look at that. You packed that manger in five minutes and you're off.
Yeah, we all have an assigned job, we pitch in.
Too bad you don't have this Christmas all year round, huh?
You'd make a pretty good living.
Actually we do a Passion Play on Easter.
And around 4th of July we do hobo revolutionaries.
Excellent choice.
I was thinking the same myself.
Okay, beautiful.
All right, you got little Jesus and the whole troupe.
Okay.
A nice man, good host.
All right, let's get to it, then.
This is fantastic.
Look at this.
Thank you, Joseph.
Yes.
We did talk about a meal, yes. for you happening?
That would be fantastic, thank you.
I guess you build a big appetite standing out here doing nothing, huh?
All right, I'll get you a little orange chicken?
But you got to be careful.
They got a lot of hot peppers in there.
All right, very good.
Hey, Joseph, let me ask you a question.
Are you okay?
I can't get rid of this thing.
It's killing me.
It's driving me nuts, Joseph.
Driving me nuts.
What?
That's it, let's pack it up.
We're leaving.
Don't Joe me, we're leaving.
You will take it back.
Get off me.
Wait a second.
The pubic hair.
Yeah, and this time the excuse was she had to go to the dentist.
That's the adult equivalent of The dog ate my homework.
I'm not making anymore dates with her.
She's done it to me before.
If she doesn't want to go to lunch, why doesn't she say,
You know what? I'd rather not go to lunch with you?
Maybe she was telling the truth.
I don't think so.
Listen, are you going to your office tomorrow?
Can you do me a favor?
Maybe.
What kind of favor am I gonna ask you wouldn't say yes to? and he told me I should get some colon cleanse.
It's actually called colon cleanse.
It helps the whole system.
What does that have to do with a cough?
I don't understand that.
All right.
Today I'll be talking about
Stuffing Your Face again.
I don't think I've eaten as badly since I was in the army.
He's coming to the opening next week.
I know, it's so subjective, isn't it?
Guy couldn't get dates.
He takes it out on the rest of the world.
I couldn't get dates. You don't see me taking it out on anybody.
I don't know about that.
Jeff's daughter goes to the same school as his son.
That's a start, right?
Jeff's not gonna say anything.
Good night.
What the hell are you kissing me good night for with that cough?
Can you get the lights, please?
You know how bookstores make you feel stupid?
Health food stores make me feel unhealthy.
What's this bullshit,
Susie making up this story about going to the dentist?
She had a dentist appointment.
She keeps breaking appointments with Cheryl.
I was with her.
What do you want?
I'm looking for a colon cleanser.
Adam, where's the colon cleanse?
Colon cleanse is aisle G, right behind you.
Okay.
It's around the corner, right there.
It's for my wife.
It's for my wife.
Boy, does he look familiar.
Does he not look familiar to you?
Who is that?
That's the chef.
Hey.
Hey, Larry.
You came in bald just to get the job?
I deceived you.
You got hired under false pretenses.
But it had nothing to do with my food.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Let's go.
I mean, what was he thinking?
For the next five years was he gonna come in every day and leave the toupee at home?
Yeah, right.
Or just wear it on weekends?
Live a double life.
He had a good plan.
You don't have a proclivity for fat people?
I think you got a strong proclivity for fat people.
If a fat guy came in, you wouldn't want to hire him?
You would've been all over that fat guy.
You would've loved that fat guy, don't tell me.
All things being equal,
I'd hire the fat guy.
That's right.
By the way, it's not like I don't hire other people who aren't bald, okay?
I don't have a bald manager.
I don't have a bald lawyer.
You have a bald accountant, a bald urologist, a bald travel agent.
You have far more bald professionals than the average person.
Okay, I notice.
It's duly noted.
I knew you'd say duly noted, too.
You know everything I say before I say it?
I knew you were gonna say that.
Aw, Jeez. Listen,
This just stinks.
Yeah, wow, you got to tell them.
I'll be there with you, but you got to tell them.
We open in four days, no chef, and you're gonna tell them you just fired our chef because he wears a toupee.
Listen, I got to go to Sammy's school, drop off her lunch, and then I'll take you to your office.
Poor kid lost his hair, he's getting chemo.
No, he's not going through chemotherapy.
You know what?
Maybe one day
That's really touching.
You've already got kind of a head start, actually.
Funny.
What's all this?
The parents and the kids, they play dodge ball.
Boy, is he into it. Have you ever talked to him about the restaurant?
I wouldn't dare.
I used to love playing dodge ball.
You like dodge ball?
Aw, they got a whole thing going here.
Come on. Sandra?
Can my friend play?
Sure.
Go ahead. I'm gonna go take the lunchbox to Sammy.
Have a good time.
Okay, let's get going here.
All right, Larry David.
I'm coming to your restaurant next week.
Come on, Larry, ha, ha, ha, ha.
You're out.
You're out.
Ow, fuck.
What have you done?
How could this possibly happen?
What were you doing playing dodge ball with Andy Portico?
Adults were playing, okay?
It was a parents and kids game.
You're injuring him.
He was acting like a bit of an asshole, too, by the way.
We open in three days, we don't have a chef.
Well, the guy was full of shit.
He tried to pass himself off as bald and he wasn't bald.
He wears a toupee when he's not here.
Who cares?
We've got more problems than that.
We have lost investors.
We are trying to open a restaurant.
You've got to pull us out of this mire that we are wallowing in.
What about the muck, are we in any muck?
We are in a big muck.
We don't have a chef.
Usually one is in muck and mire.
He said I was in a mire.
I was trying to ascertain whether or not muck was involved as well.
You know, all of this is moot because after what he did to Portico he's gonna slaughter us, okay?
He's gonna put his thumbs through the table.
Apologize to Portico.
I'll apologize.
Apologize to Portico, that's it.
What's the big deal, Larry?
All right,
I'll go apologize.
Let's talk about a new chef.
And you threw the thing like it was a fucking hydrogen bomb.
Well, I won't be able to review the restaurant, of course.
Why not?
That's my whole gimmick.
I can't do the show for two months, what am I gonna do?
I can't do my shtick.
From a stupid dodge ball game?
From a stupid dodge ball game.
Well, in any event, it's a shame that you're gonna miss the opening of the restaurant.
You're not gonna be able to review it.
What am I talking about, opening?
There's no opening anyway because we don't have a chef.
Well, that's crucial.
Yeah, I'd say.
You know, as it happens,
I know a great chef who just left Martine's.
You know Martine's?
Of course I know Martine's in New York.
As a matter of fact, he's out here now.
He's weighing offers.
I got to get this guy's name.
Guy Bernier is his name.
I could put in a word for you.
Hey, look, I'm happy to do it.
No hard feelings, honestly.
It's like this could've happened to anyone.
I brought you your lunch.
Excuse me.
Okay, you fucking idiot, you fucking moron.
How am I supposed to eat that?
Suck it up my ass?
Hey, you know what? Don't worry about it, I'll help you out here.
Let's make this happen.
Okay? Come on.
No, come on now, really, honestly.
Andy, will you stop it?
Good, good, good.
What the fuck are you doing?
Here you go.
I think I should mention that I have one problem.
And that problem is with salmon.
I won't buy it,
I won't broil it I won't bake it.
Oh.
You got a problem with salmon, huh?
I can't stand capers either.
I don't like them.
If I see one caper in the kitchen, there's going to be big problem.
Do you remember
Martine's in New York?
Sure, I've been there about three or four times.
Et voila.
Okay, well, now I have appointment.
I have to go.
Nice job.
Shit, shitface fuck, shit, cocksucker.
I bet he got a ticket.
Shall we break out the champagne?
Yeah, let's crack open a bottle of the good stuff.
Look at your car.
Are you kidding me?
Ugh, it's dirty.
All of it.
You need to wash this, seriously.
Okay, fine,
I'll wash it right now.
Not now.
You can't do it now.
I'm meeting Susie for lunch.
It's right on the way, don't worry about it.
I don't want to be late for it.
It takes two minutes.
I just don't want
Hear that note?
Outstanding.
And they are miles
How long do you think this is gonna last?
What's the deal here?
Are we even moving?
Are we moving?
How long is this thing supposed to take?
Do you know?
I got news for you.
We're not even moving.
Hey.
I can't be in this car for much longer.
Hey.
Hey.
Hello, yes,
Los Angeles.
Yes, connect.
Hello, I'm stuck in your car wash.
What?
I said I'm stuck in your car wash.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
I got to go.
I got to go. I got to go.
I got to go.
I'm just saying
Susie's crazed, man.
She hung up on Cheryl.
A car wash?
Who gets stuck in a car wash?
It's the truth.
We were stuck in a car wash.
You weren't stuck in a car wash.
Olives?
What do you do with pit?
Ever, never, you can do nothing with pit.
It's ridiculous.
No olives.
A pit plate?
Why don't you call it a garbage plate?
He's a piece of work.
What about lemon in the water?
Motherfucking cocksucker asshole.
I'm starting to think that that's involuntary.
Et voila.
Everything is finished now.
It's perfect, it's fantastic, okay?
I just want to say one thing.
Bye bye. I see you tomorrow, yes?
See you tomorrow.
Wow. He's got
Tourette's Syndrome.
Portico.
Portico.
That prick,
I don't believe it.
He's laughing right now.
That motherfucker.
Of course he would.
The joke's on us 'cause we need to find another chef.
Yeah, we got to let him go.
What? We're opening tomorrow.
You want to let him go?
It would be different if the kitchen didn't look out onto the dining room.
He's practically on stage over there.
We're gonna be known as the restaurant with the chef that swears.
This is a nightmare.
This'll ruin us.
We're gonna be a laughingstock if we allow this to happen.
Are you kidding me?
We have to get rid of him.
He's a survivor.
Okay.
There was too much noise.
The only people who could hear him worked in the kitchen.
But our kitchen's right in the front.
He's gonna be right there, cursing up a storm.
People could be eating their dinner.
Yeah, I'm not gonna fire a survivor.
No, you couldn't do that.
Whoa, wow.
Look at you.
Is it too
Knots Landing?
I know it's a TV show, but I don't get the reference at all.
Well, maybe he won't curse tonight.
He can't control it.
Nothing he can control.
I've seen him twice and he's cursed both times.
The only thing
I don't get is why he doesn't curse in French.
Why is he cursing in English?
Mutherfuckerre.
Cocksuckerre.
All in English,
I don't understand.
Aren't there obscenities in French there that he could say?
Listen, can I just tell you, before we even get there,
I am not looking forward to running into Susie Greene?
Susie Greene, yeah.
She hates me. She really hates me now.
She won't even talk to me.
You know? I mean, what am I gonna do?
I wouldn't even go if I were you.
It's too awkward.
You're probably right.
Maybe I'll just sit in the car.
How about that?
Really, that's what you should do.
All right, let's get out of here.
Wow.
Look at that.
There's a room over there.
See the bell?
Now watch this.
Hi, Jeff, good to see you.
This is Cheryl.
These are my investor friends.
I am very impressed.
This is not what I expected.
We couldn't have done it without the big guy here.
He stepped up.
It was a little rocky there for a while.
That's an understatement.
I think Jim's had a couple of champagnes.
I think Jim's out of control.
I'm a little nervous, but I think we're gonna make it.
Eat your heart out, Ted Danson.
That's all I have to say.
Cheers.
Cheers, yeah, you got it.
Yeah, cheers.
Where's your wife?
And what's going on with Guy?
Hey, there's my dad.
Hello.
Pilaf.
Actually, I'm quite upset.
I'm very upset.
Yes, look at that.
What's the point, huh?
It's all rigged, anyway.
I'm quite sure of that, huh?
Hey, turn that down.
What do you think you are doing, cooking a goat?
Let's get that waiter.
Maybe one day,
Cock.
Cock, jism.
Grandma, cock.
Cunt, piss, shit, bugger and balls.
Fuck you, you car wash cunt.
I had a dental appointment.
Fellatio, cunnilingus,
French kissing.
Rim job.
Right, piss.
Fucking, fucking, fuck, fuck.
Schmuck, putz, tuchuslecker.
Pussy, pig fucker.
Balls.
Boy cock, girl cock,
What?
Because of what?
What's the sauce with the fish?
What, what fish?
He didn't even mention the fish.
I'll just have the first thing.
They should write the thing down.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I'm sure it's been on your mind.
Our anniversary.
I would like for us to renew our vows and have a real wedding ceremony.
I'll tell you what, you just built it all up.
I did. I didn't know how I was gonna bring it up, but thank you.
Now let's talk about my 10th anniversary present.
All right.
What would you like?
I believe my present has already been agreed upon.
In these seats.
Same seats.
I feel like we're married already.
We're just making it legal.
It's just gonna be, you know, permanent
Wait a minute. They think you're crazy? How dare they?
Well, that's what I say.
Which friends think you're crazy?
I don't want to name names, but look it's working, right?
I just think that we should be a family, you know?
We should share the same last name.
I want to be Cheryl David.
Davids want to be out of being Davids.
I don't want to be a David,
I have to be a David.
But if you don't have to be a David, why be a David?
I feel like I have to be a David.
Okay okay.
What?
If that's your hold up here, then let's just do that.
Come on, you're not gonna let me do that.
Just sex one time.
It's not a big deal.
Wow, you have a good memory.
All right, well, all right.
It's our 10th anniversary.
I said it 10 years ago.
What does that mean?
Hey, lady.
I'm Larry David
Even if I wanted to, you don't think I'm capable of it.
No, I don't think you're capable of it.
I really don't.
Well, thank you.
How long do I have to do this?
You have until our anniversary and that's it.
Good luck.
I just hope Jeff is gonna be at that karaoke party
Because I have got a lot to say to that young man.
Listen, maybe we should skip the karaoke party.
Why do you want to skip karaoke?
Horrible?
I'll make it worth your while.
Do you know married men everywhere, that's their dream that their wife says, Yeah, go ahead.
What's Mel doing here?
Frank's been in, like, two of his movies.
They're old friends.
This is great. You got permission.
Come on, man.
She actually challenged me to do it.
You've got to, man.
Whom I am supposed to do this with?
That doesn't mean I could walk up to them and do anything.
But now you've got permission.
This is the thing that
I'm the worst at in the world, this.
This and drawing.
It's a big thing to do.
How could I do that?
Do you think
I could do it?
You want to see how inept I really am, huh?
Just go. Yeah, go make a move.
Show me. Just practice.
I'll watch.
Go ahead.
What can you do at night?
Bowling, movies.
It's like a third thing to do after bowling and the movies.
I don't know if you bowl.
I don't go that often,
But it's fun, it's fun. You can't find a ball, that's the problem.
I don't know, maybe you own a bowling ball. I don't own one.
My whole life, every time
I'm in a bowling alley
Sticking my fingers in all these holes, picking up the balls.
You gotta get your own ball.
I don't bowl enough to get my own ball.
It takes up a lot of space in the house.
You keep looking at it in the closet going,
What I am doing with a bowling ball?
I don't even bowl.
How do you get rid of a bowling ball?
Think about that.
Who do you give a bowling ball to?
Nobody bowls.
The thing, it only fits your fingers.
You throw a bowling ball in the garbage can, you know what that sanitation man's gonna do?
He's gonna knock on your door, that's how upset he's gonna be.
He's gonna say, Who the fuck threw a bowling ball in the garbage?
Okay, all right.
I'm around town.
How did it go?
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Come on, everybody.
Put it together. Mel Brooks.
How about that?
That was fantastic.
All right, now, who wants to go next?
Anyone?
I can't do it.
Mel Brooks wants?
I have no idea.
Usually I know.
He's one of my idols, you know?
I know he is.
That's why I was excited for you.
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
What the fuck?
I'm trying to walk.
While you're talking on a cell phone?
You almost killed me, douche bag.
You cut right in front of me talking on the phone?
There's a law against talking on a cell phone?
No, you can't, not while you're wheeling around. You almost hit my car.
Learn how to drive that thing.
Piss off.
Hey,
Wow, there's money in here.
Larry David,
Jeff Greene to see Mel.
He'll be with you in a second.
Have a seat.
You know what?
I found this thing in the lobby.
Oh.
He does the computers in the building.
It probably fell out of his chair this morning.
I'll bet that's the guy.
You know that?
A guy in a wheelchair cut right in front of my car in the parking lot.
I almost hit him.
The guy was talking on his cell phone.
Yeah, I know.
It's a moving vehicle.
He's motoring along.
You don't need to be talking on a cell phone. It's dangerous.
Mel will be right out.
Yes, actually my partner and I are adopting a baby.
You got yourself a partner.
Not exactly a partner.
You know what I mean?
It's a rivalry.
And we are adopting him from China.
Chinese names.
Do I know any Chinese names?
Remember Wang Lung?
Wang isn't a bad first name. Wang?
Then you got the whole Ang family.
It's a juice is what it is.
Mel will be right with you.
You know what?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
Just sign in and the doctor will be with you in a minute.
Oh.
Do I actually have to put my name on this thing?
Yes. Yeah.
I generally don't like to put my name on these lists.
Just sign in.
I don't like having my name on these lists.
Then sign Ben Vereen.
Who cares what you sign? Come on.
Your head's bleeding.
Just sign in.
Yes.
What are you calling me
I'm bored to death in here.
Don't use the doctor's phone.
That's not right.
Well, I just thought
I'd give you a call,
See what's up, how you're doing.
What are you reading?
Yeah, about
There's the doctor.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
I will, uh,
I'll talk to you later.
That was Jeff.
It was a local call.
You're not supposed to use the phone.
It doesn't matter whether it was a local or a long distance call.
We just don't want people using that phone, okay?
What's the problem?
There is no problem. We just don't want people using that phone.
I don't understand why not, though.
Why couldn't I use it?
Well, you could use it.
You obviously did.
We don't want you to use it, though.
With all due respect,
I don't understand the rule.
I don't see what the big deal is.
The history of how we arrived at that
Just let it be said that we don't allow anyone
To use the phones in the examination rooms.
I just don't see how it's hurting anybody.
It's not hurting anybody.
We just have a rule.
You don't use the doctor's phone.
You're saying not to use it, but what's the reason?
I don't understand why you have to know the reason.
I'm just trying to understand why you decided that.
It seems very capricious to me.
Let's have a look.
I got hit by a door.
Wow. Sit down, will you?
Mel Brooks is coming out of a bathroom
I like Mel Brooks. I'm a big fan.
Lay down, will you?
I have tickets for his play
The Producers.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, it just seems like an odd policy to me, though.
It's a rule that is universal in examination rooms.
We don't have many rules here.
That's one of them.
It seems odd, though, that if you're making a local call that anybody would care, but whatever.
It's not the expense of the call we're concerned about.
I don't know if you've ever had stitches before, but there is a slight bit of pain involved.
Nothing more, I would say, than a little prick.
Yeah, there's one prick involved.
Yeah, I'd say there is one prick involved.
I agree. I'm not a doctor, but I agree there is one prick.
Yep.
And the more I look at this,
I think this is pretty minor.
What the hell?
I have been thinking about it.
And?
You know,
I got three months.
And you, my fat friend, will be the first to know.
All right, good.
I should be.
My big fat friend.
Did you get your wallet?
Joanne gave it to me in Mel Brooks's office.
Yeah right, right.
I gave it to her.
That's not what she said.
That's an exact quote,
I found this?
She said she found the wallet, gave it to me and I gave her 100 bucks.
Seriously, you should worry a little bit less about the wallet
And maybe maintain a little focus on your driving skills, buddy.
Hello.
Jeff Greene, Larry David to see Mel.
You know, I ran into the guy in the wheelchair downstairs.
Your friend, Dennis.
He told me that you said that you found the wallet, and he gave you $100 reward?
Yeah. You need a good fuckin' ass kicking.
That's what you need.
You want to name our baby Tang?
You think it's good to name a kid after a breakfast drink?
We don't think that's a good name.
Do you understand that?
You apologize to her.
You apologize now.
What are you doing here anyway?
I got a meeting with Mel Brooks.
And I guess you're wondering why I called you.
Kind of, yeah.
Do you remember the other night
I sang at the karaoke club and then you got up? and then you sang Swanee and they went crazy.
And when you sang,
In a couple of months, the guy playing
Max Bialystock will be going out on the road, leaving an empty slot called Max Bialystock, the leading character in The Producers.
I want you,
Larry David, to be the next
Max Bialystock on Broadway.
I would like you to play the lead in The Producers.
When this thing goes off,
I'm not, like a theater actor.
When we made the movie of The Producers,
The guy that played Carmen Ghia was this incredible, talented greek actor.
His name is Andreas,
Andreas Voutsinas.
Or you got it or you ain't.
I said, Andreas, you can't start a sentence with 'or.
He said, Never mind.
Or you got it, or you ain't.
You got it, Larry.
I got a great idea.
Go to the show tonight.
See the show.
Let it get into your pores, let it get into your system.
I'm telling you I'm never wrong.
I am never wrong.
It's like Allen Funt or Jamie Kennedy's gonna come walking through the door.
You were born to do it.
Just see the show tonight, see what happens.
See what happens and then let this all come back to you.
Okay?
Okay, Jeff, tell him in the elevator.
Tell him how great he is.
I did all the plays in high school.
I swear to God.
They gave me the lead, every one.
Are your M4 and M5?
Are those your house seats?
They'll be there.
Pick 'em up at the box office.
I know what you're gonna say.
When I know, I know.
And this time, I know.
Thank you very much.
All right.
What's wrong?
Aw, this thing's killing me.
You know, I'm gonna take a painkiller, I think.
It's killing me.
It really hurts.
How are you gonna take it without water?
Okay okay.
Okay, Larry.
Ben Stiller?
Hi.
Mel Brooks hit me with a bathroom door.
Cut my head.
What, were you talking to him?
I am, yeah.
He offered me the Max Bialystock.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Because it took him a long time to make this decision.
Yeah, and you sing?
I don't do anything, really.
They'll have to teach me.
No, it's true, but I'm still thinking about it.
Honey, actually I see Brian and Lee.
We should go say hi.
Good to see you.
See you later.
Lar, good luck.
This is a big decision. Take care.
I'll watch it tonight and think about it.
And we'll talk about apartments if you need to.
Why didn't you shake his hand?
He put his hand out for you.
He sneezed all over his hand.
He didn't notice anything.
Of course he noticed that.
Everyone noticed that.
I'm not going to shake his hand.
It's got snot all over it, come on.
Partners, Leo, all the way.
And nothing or no one will ever come between us.
Nothing or no one, Max.
Believe me, I will not think any less of you.
No, I don't want to get out of it.
A deal's a deal.
I just want to tell you that there's a few ground rules that we need to talk about, okay?
Okay, one time only.
And there's a deadline.
It's our anniversary at midnight, then it's over.
Yeah, kind of like
Cinderella.
My opening night is the same night as our anniversary.
Really?
That would be fun.
What do you think?
You think you want to do the show?
You know, maybe I will.
Maybe I will.
Thank God you stopped.
I'm gonna start with your shoes, okay?
I told you to get
Capezio jazz oxfords.
I will get those shoes today.
I've been doing this since I was seven.
Why can't I just do that?
Because that's not the choreography.
You move your feet. Nobody knows what the hell's is going on down there.
I'm Michael.
Yeah, Larry.
Michael.
I helped you move three years ago.
Me and Richard Lewis.
You were standing on the street.
Ah? Ah?
That's amazing.
This is my girlfriend Rhonda.
Can you believe it?
I hooked up with a model.
Boy, you lucked out.
How's it going?
This is my girlfriend Rhonda.
Rhonda, nice to meet you.
Hands off.
She's taken.
Hey, listen, I'm having a birthday party on Saturday night.
You guys are all invited to come, all right? but we're having the party this Saturday.
Thank you,
I'd love to come.
Yeah, and no gifts, okay? No gifts.
How come you're having a party on Saturday if it was two weeks ago?
Christine was out of town, we couldn't get it together
Why not just forget it, wait till next year?
I wish we could've done it last week, but we couldn't get it together.
You should bring Cheryl.
It'll be fun.
Kind of reminds me a little of like President's Day.
It's not really the President's birthday.
Right.
We're back.
Let's start at the top of the scene.
It's a total scam.
He introduced her as a model.
She's like completely bullshitting this guy 'cause he's blind.
Thank you for coming to meet Kim.
I might've mentioned Kenny.
He's old my friend in New York.
She just moved out here from the city.
This is his first daughter, and she calls me like Uncle Richard.
That's fun,
Uncle Richard.
Yeah, but the problem is she's an actress, a singer, talented but she wants to get her breasts enlarged, and it's gonna drive
I need you to help to talk her out of it.
Just like a breast intervention.
How am I supposed to bring this up?
That's okay.
I don't know.
Is everything else good in your life?
I have nothing to confide.
You have experienced a lot you have not shared.
You've mentioned this to me that I don't confide in you,
Look at you from top to bottom.
What a doll, huh?
This is my fake niece Kim.
Larry David.
Larry, Kim.
I think a full
It's the thought that counts. Listen,
You know, I mean,
I could take a look at it.
I'm not doing TV right now.
I'm doing really well.
They're not real though, are they?
Huh?
Look at all his gifts.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to bring a present.
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.
Did you bring a gift?
Nobody means that.
Exciting, that's great.
It's going, it's going.
What should I do with this thing?
I think a woman will come around.
You can put it on a table.
Every time I get one of these,
I wind up holding it the whole night.
It's a lot of dancing you guys have to do.
Is he exhausted when he comes home?
It's not that I'm not working as hard, but it looks more effortless maybe.
Yeah, like an idiot holding the skewer.
No, you should mingle.
It's your birthday.
It's your party.
Mingle if you want to.
If you see a skewer guy will you send him over?
Bye.
Did you tell Lar about my new thing?
No, I actually didn't. Why don't you tell Larry about your new thing?
I got them in the trunk.
Wanna see them?
I wanna say hello to Michael, the piano player from the show?
He can't see my clothes?
Get out of here.
How did you know that?
Yeah, well,
I saw through it.
Listen, what are you doing next week?
Tuesday night I'm doing a set at The Mint. Can you come?
You'll enjoy it.
Show tunes.
Tuesday I think
I have a clan meeting.
Don't you think she's beautiful?
You don't think she's beautiful, Larry?
I don't say beautiful.
She's nice.
Huh.
She told you she was a model?
I don't wanna talk about it.
What's the difference?
You can't see her anyway.
What is that, a myth?
I though blind people had better hearing.
I don't know.
I've never had it tested.
What's going on?
Wait till you see them.
You are gonna die.
Okay.
Now, is this cute?
I mean, how much fun is this, huh? but, you know, it's nice.
All right, you know what?
Whoever said you had taste,
It's nice. You know, we all can't like the same things.
When I showed them to Ben Stiller, he happened to love them.
I have to be honest with you.
Stop right now.
I'll be right up.
That's the next six months of our lives.
This is the woman from the show, right?
She's coming to Broadway with us?
Yeah, she plays Ulla here, and she's going with the New York Company.
Yeah. Come on.
Yeah. She's nice.
How are you?
It was a couple weeks ago.
You shouldn't be having a birthday party two weeks after your birthday.
I mean, what's the statute of limitations there?
Why don't I have my birthday?
My birthday was two months ago.
Okay, three days.
No more than that, though.
It's not your birthday anymore.
There's gotta be a time, where you can't have birthday parties.
Wait till next year.
You missed it. you missed the party.
What is this?
I'm walking around with this skewer all night now.
You can't get rid of these things, you know?
I don't like a kebab. I don't know what your feelings are about a kebab,
And then, you got this stick.
What do you do?
You put it in your pocket?
Stick yourself in the scrotum?
Then what do you got?
The garden has trees is what I said, Sammi.
Maybe I'll join in.
Well, I don't see any space, Larry.
Very nice of you,
Alexandra. Okay.
Let's play a little telephone.
You got one, honey?
Okay.
Okay.
I love tits?
It's funny to say that in a room full of children?
Your sick, perverse mind twisted it around.
It's not funny.
No, he didn't.
Okay, he did not say it.
We're gonna go sing
Happy Birthday. Come on.
Tell them what you said.
You know you didn't say that.
Yeah.
Let's say that's the ball, okay?
You wanna take the club and give it back to the catcher.
Shit.
Jesus. Fuck.
Ow.
Skewer.
You guys see how much easier it is with the right shoes?
Okay, and here's the other thing.
That's the rehearsal tempo, all right?
That's the way I taught it to you to break it down.
But it's more like this, all right?
Got it?
You're behind.
Five minutes, everyone.
Five minutes.
Use your time wisely.
That's bullshit. That's not the tempo. Get out of here.
Well, I don't know how any human could dance to that tempo.
Forget it.
It's a comic book character.
Wore the red costume.
The guy in the red costume.
It's hard to talk to a blind guy.
You have no references.
I don't know comics,
Larry.
I look like Brad Pitt, but unfortunately she can see. You dig?
Hey, Ben, you're here.
Hey, Steve.
It's that skewer, that fucking skewer.
Ben, I never sing
Happy Birthday.
I feel uncomfortable,
Come on, everybody knows that's bullshit.
You really have a little ways to go
You don't even shake my hand the first time I see you.
You had snot on your hand.
You'd just sneezed.
That was a dry sneeze,
Larry.
I won't put out my hand if it's full of snot.
I didn't know it was air.
I thought I saw speckles flying.
I saw snot speckles flying.
Top of the page, page 31.
I didn't call, but I was in the neighborhood and I wanted to bring by my headshot and my reel and stuff like that.
There you go.
Wow, you have a really beautiful house.
Yeah, we had to move.
Listen, I've got a book
I want to give to Richard.
Are you kidding me? You don't notice anything different about me?
Genius.
Don't they look real?
Remember you said they wouldn't look real? Do they not look real?
You want to see them?
Check them out. Look.
They're good, right?
Feel them. They feel totally natural.
Feel 'em.
Check 'em out.
They feel good, right?
Squeeze them.
Come on.
Well, guess what?
Happy anniversary.
Because that was your 10th anniversary gift right there.
You can't do that.
That wasn't sex.
You just had sex.
Touching a breast is sex.
It was like putting my hand on her head.
It was nothing.
Then why didn't you put your hand on her head?
Cause she didn't put my hand on her head. She put it over here.
I like that you can't control your own hands.
She took my hands and went like that.
I saw it. I saw it, Larry.
That's it.
A lot of people call it that.
You are obsessed with tits.
The kid said, I love tits.
That's what he said to me.
Why are you talking to little boys about tits?
He whispered it to me.
It was part of the game.
Have you ever played telephone before?
You don't know how to play telephone, do you?
Yeah, but I play
Susie lives down the lane.
The kid didn't say,
Susie lives down the lane.
He said,
I love tits.
I'll be right over.
All right, sit tight.
What did you do?
I don't understand. looking woman.
And since you were kind enough to point that out to me, she had to go. woman? Who do you think you are?
Look, that doesn't matter.
She was indispensable.
Don't you have any friends?
Yes, I have friends, but I'm not gonna impose on them.
I think you should help me.
You're the one who got me into this mess.
I need a little help.
Thanks a lot, Larry.
Just grab it this way.
You don't have to get in between.
I actually wanna buy one of those shirts. cause Susie said he liked it, right?
The eye is not the problem.
The problem was that I didn't sing Happy Birthday.
I was right about those sticks, though.
I looked around at that party at one point.
I saw five people holding sticks.
I did. I was checking.
You can't put that down on a table.
You have to wait for a server to come by.
Get the shirt.
Do not say it's for Ben.
Say it's for you.
She's all pissed off about the other night.
Fine, yeah, okay.
Susie.
What the fuck do you want, Larry?
Well, you know what?
I would love to buy one of those shirts.
It's like you go to a movie and it kind of stays with you.
A good movie.
You know what I mean?
And so,
I don't know,
I know they're great shirts.
You know they're great shirts.
Because the shirt was talking to me, and I need a little more flair.
I don't have any flair.
That is true.
I have them in the trunk.
We'll pick out a color.
Lar, it's like
Okay, I think the red would look good on you cause you're kind of pale and pasty, and this is a great color, the red. It's fun.
Why are you saying pale and pasty?
Well, you are. You're not one from the sunshine.
I play golf.
I'm out. I get sun.
All right, Larry,
I just think the red is a good color.
I have blue,
You know, I had a friend whose sister went there years ago.
I don't think
I have a bag.
No, you know, Lar?
Me to you.
Your money's no good here, darling.
You get everything the first time.
No no no, I've been drilling that thing for two hours.
Well, see, you do your homework, which is good.
Right there.
Turn around.
Happy birthday.
This is ridiculous.
You don't have to do that, Larry.
Let me just say,
I've been like stressed out of my mind.
Listen, I stabbed you in the eye, man.
No, I've been crazed about this thing, and getting into your space, and I shouldn't.
You're doing what you're doing.
All right? And you didn't have to get me a gift.
Indiana.
I thought it was like a perfect gift.
Like a fun sweatshirt.
Okay, guys, Let's get started.
Top of scene three.
Not off book yet, huh?
Not on this scene.
Not on this scene.
Larry, you enter from stage left.
Is that my left, or if I'm sitting in the audience my left?
I always get those mixed up.
That's very hard.
Leo. Leo.
I can't take anymore.
Thank you.
You know, you should get one of these cordless vacuums.
Hey, Mikey boy.
I was just listening to music.
You know what? You better get a new girlfriend, all right?
Cause this isn't gonna last that much longer.
Yeah, well, whose fault is it that I don't have a girlfriend anymore?
Hey, I did you a favor.
The problem is it's hard to fix you up.
I would like to be with an attractive woman, yes. What guy wouldn't?
Not only does she have
What matters to women is what's on the inside of a fella.
Okay, first of all, you've got nothing inside of you, okay?
Let me just make that clear.
You are the most superficial man I've ever met, blind or sighted, okay?
Be that as it may, it's just not fair that people get to see her and I don't.
It's not fair everybody knows what she looks like except you?
Right.
It's not fair.
You've all heard
Argh. Argh.
Fuck.
There he is. Honey, right here. He's right here.
I still can't see out of this side.
Yeah, come on in.
Hang on a second.
Wait, just stop.
Stop.
Okay, now.
We're taking Christine to yoga class and then we'll go to rehearsal, okay?
Is that a prefix, you think, yo?
They're both healthy things.
Yoghurt, yoga.
I don't think so.
Larry, great seeing you. from the movie?
She can't hear you.
Why don't you come up front?
Eh, I'm okay.
Come on up front.
I'm good.
I'm not gonna drive you around like a chauffeur. Get in the front seat.
You're not driving me around like a chauffeur.
We're two minutes from the rehearsal hall.
Subliminally you're telling me you need me to drive you around.
Why do I have to leave my seat, go into the front seat?
Because I asked you to, and it's my car and if it's my car,
You're such a baby.
I'm saying you're a little baby.
Little baby wants a ride?
We'll give little baby a ride.
Mr David, where to now?
Here we go, driving Mr Larry.
Hey, take it easy, man.
Cause I want to take a poll, that makes me a baby?
Look at this thing you're walking around with,
Good morning. your little cousin finished all the Grape Nuts this morning.
How much longer, by the way?
I don't know, three or four days.
I don't know.
We'll see. We'll see.
All right.
Hey, if it's okay with you,
I'm taking your car today.
You know what? Maybe while you're out, you could get it washed.
It looks pretty clean, by the way.
Now you have to tell me when to stop.
Stop.
Efficiently and any way possible.
Okay, fine, it's all shuffled.
Wow.
I can't tell you.
No, magicians don't tell people how they do their tricks.
Were you a magician before you knew how to do that trick?
Mmm, not really.
Well, who taught you how to do the trick?
A magician.
A magician taught you how to do the trick, right?
I can't, just 'cause you said I am a magician,
I can't teach you.
He can tell that I'm a magician.
Well, you can tell that I'm a magician.
But I'm a magician, just naturally a magician.
That's what you're saying.
I'm saying I'm naturally a magician.
I mean, see, because I'm a magician, if you were naturally a magician,
I'd feel that you were naturally a magician.
You guys are a lot alike.
Yeah, except he's not a magician.
You got the energy for that
You know who pops in?
You're not gonna believe this.
Cheryl.
Can you believe that?
What do you mean?
Yeah, she was there.
I couldn't believe it.
Boom, she was there.
You can't control who pops in.
She pops in.
She pops in?
Why didn't you pop her out?
I tried popping her out.
She wouldn't pop out.
I want to be here with you, Jeff?
I couldn't pop her out,
I'm not in control of it.
Besides, my bench is thin.
I don't have a lot going on there.
Your bench is thin?
What, is she on your team now?
No, she's not on my team.
She popped in.
I don't want you using my wife anymore for that, okay?
I'll never intentionally use your wife for that.
Yeah?
Okay, next time she pops in, pick your pants up and get out of the room.
Hello.
Good.
How's the adoption coming? Good?
Wait till you get the kid.
It'll change your life.
Get the kid?
Mel will be with you in just a second.
How are you doing?
It's a decision.
Do you have any complaints?
I mean, how's it going for you?
I've got one tiny thing, just one small issue.
I'm not happy with the toilet paper in the rehearsal hall.
Yeah, right.
Ben Stiller is gone.
He is history.
He has left us.
He came to me and said,
It's either me or Larry David.
Make up your mind.
Larry David, Stiller out.
I don't know, minor stuff.
You wouldn't sit in the front of a car?
You couldn't move into the front of the car?
They were two minutes away from where they were going.
I happen to have a small phobia about shaking people's hands who have snot on it.
At the party, everybody sang
Happy Birthday but you.
I don't like it either.
I hate it.
Did you hear this thing with the shish kabob?
You know about that?
That's painful.
Blessing in disguise.
He's a wonderful actor.
He's a fantastic actor.
I don't think he belongs in musical comedy, frankly.
Done, done.
Listen, you know, don't worry about Ben Stiller.
In my mind, I've got a couple of wonderful people.
Think about that guy.
Think about that.
He can move well, sings well.
And we'd save a little money on the marquee.
Larry David Schwimmer, get it?
God bless. Keep up the good work.
Mel, Mel, you're making a terrible mistake.
He's mentally challenged.
Car wash. Car wash.
For the Langley Center.
It's a charity and it's where we all belong.
Everybody's seeing
I'm putting it in my pocket, okay.
Nothing's coming off this.
Could you close the door?
Cause you're spraying it all inside.
You're making it a bigger mess than it was.
I think it's okay now.
No, it ain't looking like it's supposed to.
I guess I'll get going now.
That's okay.
No no, just give me one more minute, okay?
Fuck.
Well, guess what?
I'm out of gas.
You left no gas in the car.
How do you drive around like that?
I don't know.
I'm nowhere near a gas station.
You know what?
Where's my sunblock?
I'll bet you those guys took my sunblock.
I was at a gas station, cause I got your car washed.
You know what?
All right, goodbye.
Would it be possible?
I did the Seinfeld show,
Hello, how are you?
I beg you.
May I help you?
My car is out of gas, and I'm just desperate to use a bathroom.
Come in, please come in.
Be my invited guest.
Whoa.
Whoo.
Refreshed?
If you're ever in my neighborhood and you need to use a toilet, I'm your guy.
Is there anything else
I can do for you?
You just did me an enormous favor.
You got room for another one?
I need to get gas for my car.
I'm joking.
I would be pleased to take you to get gas.
That is unbelievable.
My wife left me with no gas.
I thought maybe
We're a very superficial people.
Hmm.
What?
What is it?
I think I've got a guy for you.
All right, look,
I'll tell you what.
I've worked up a little appetite.
This place is beautiful.
Hey, it's the guys from the car wash.
Hey, guys.
You guys did a good job on that car. Thank you.
Wow, pretty good.
Congratulations.
Hey, guys, let me ask you a question.
Did you happen to see any sunblock on the passenger seat in my car?
I didn't know that.
No, at the car wash, there were four of you.
I don't know what.
I think we know what happened to the sunblock.
We lied.
Yeah, we lied to you.
It's really good tuna salad.
It's good?
Tunafish on your lap.
What are you gonna do?
I insist. I'm gonna dryclean it for you.
Okay, Larry.
Okay.
Hey, I've got a good joke.
I didn't tell the joke yet.
Wait till I tell the joke.
I mean, it's quite amazing when you think about it.
Everybody's in the same boat as you.
You have leveled the playing field for me, Larry.
Nobody will ever know what she looks like.
What an idea.
That's just great.
Thank you.
They require a chaperon.
You know, there's no downside here.
Really, there's none, it's perfect.
It's perfect.
Call her up.
She's quite a Muslim.
Okay, tell me when to stop.
Stop.
Maybe I'm just not stopping where you want me to stop.
No, it's not.
This is your card.
Okay, ahem.
You listen to me,
I apologize. I can't do anything.
You're not a magician.
Cause you know one trick, that makes you a magician?
That's not a magician.
One trick's not a magician.
Yeah, it is.
I'm taking half that candy.
Don't say a word to her.
You put it in the pantry,
I'll divide it up. Understand?
Okay.
Look at Andy Divine over here.
Yes, I am, Sheriff.
What are you wearing?
What is this, no costume?
I've spent an hour getting ready for this.
I don't have anything else to wear.
Not so.
Excuse me.
I've got just the thing.
Haboos's burka.
Just back from the drycleaners.
You're going as an Islamic fundamentalist.
It's hot in this thing.
What the fuck?
Hey, Osama, go back to your own fucking country.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah, I'm a little nervous, but let's give it a shot.
I'm a little concerned about the weather.
It's all right.
Just be casual.
Fixed your cloak.
Larry. Thank you.
It's kind of a sexy thing.
Did I tell you?
Did I tell you?
You got the drizzles.
It's drizzling. I don't know.
You know what?
It's like daredevil.
You're like daredevil.
Oh.
Please shuffle the deck.
Thank you.
Yeah, you peeked.
You bent it so you could peek at it.
You looked at it from behind.
How'd you know?
Anyone can figure that out.
The game's about to start.
Well, he's probably in the bathroom.
Larry David.
Why don't you close the door?
I'd like to give you
I want the other one.
Get out.
I'm the only one here, baby.
There.
There we go, Larry.
Let me get this cotton out for you and you'll be ready for Dr. Funkhouser.
Thank you,
You're not gonna throw up this time.
Why didn't you tell me that you're allergic?
Wide, open up wide.
That's very, very angry and red today.
But I think it's gonna be fine.
By the way, it was very nice of you to RSVP for my uncle Leo's testimonial.
How could I miss his testimonial?
I've got people coming from Russia.
I don't see him playing golf anymore.
It's a little sedative. You can't take the gas, this is the alternative.
Roll up the sleeve and we'll do it.
Come on, come on, come on.
You afraid of the needle?
No, you know what?
I'm just concerned that if I roll it up, it's gonna lose its elasticity.
You see how it kind of clings to the wrist now?
You can wear a sock 500 times with no problem.
I'm a expert on, and I'm an expert on elastic.
All right, you know what, Larry?
If you're that concerned about it, just take it off.
Excuse me, Mr Sherman is on the phone.
Okay, fine. You know what?
We're gonna roll this right up
I have people with real problems in there and I have to do this now.
I have an hysteric on the phone,
I have people in the waiting room, and this is enough already.
It's enough.
Know what I'm saying?
Look at this cuff.
And it's flopping all over the place.
Look at that.
His uncle has Hodgkin's.
Yeah, but it's the good Hodgkin's.
I didn't know there was a good Hodgkin's.
I'm not saying it's a great Hodgkin's.
It's a good Hodgkin's.
Next time you use the bathroom, make sure to keep the seat down.
What are you,
It's not really about her, it's about me.
I got very comfortable with it.
Keep it down.
You stand like a person.
I'm very upset with this. This is crazy.
You know what
Winston Churchill said?
Why stand when you can sit?
Have you ever heard that expression?
No, I never heard that.
But I don't think he meant the toilet.
Do you want me to get those glaucoma drops for you at the drugstore?
Yes, I'm just about out of them.
Ted asked us to take care of his dog.
It's just gonna be me?
Okay, fine.
Look what this dentist did to my shirt today.
No matter where I sit at these dinner parties, it always seems like every conversation is more interesting than the one I've having.
Right. Except when you're sitting next to me.
No, it still feels that way.
What are you doing? what have you got, the mail?
Dr. Funkhouser.
He didn't mention anything about it.
I just saw him.
I can't believe he already sent a bill.
That was fast.
He needs his money.
Eeew, aaah.
Here's a copy of the picture of your tooth for insurance purposes?
Why didn't they send it to the insurance company? I don't need that.
My God.
This is great. You came from Russia for your uncle's testimonial?
It's nice. You get to see your cousin Marty, right?
He loves Marty.
I like talking through a translator.
It's fun, yeah.
I wish I could do this with my wife.
What's with the bare feet?
It's more comfortable this way.
I don't really like people trying my glasses on.
No.
What are you doing?
No. Nyet.
Okay.
This Russian is nuts.
He just grabbed for my glasses.
I said I don't like when people try my glasses on.
Great, I have to have dinner and look at his disgusting feet all night?
It would've been nice to have him here.
Instead of all these Funkhousers.
Yeah, it's chock full of Funkhousers.
Jeffrey, I need you in the kitchen, honey.
Oskie, come here, boy.
Come here, boy. Yeah.
Who's a good boy?
Yeah, good boy.
Enjoying the dog?
Dinner's served.
And he's gonna take care of Ted's dog.
Very good.
You can stay up
Maybe you should take your shoes off like that guy.
Take my shoes off like that guy?
What are you doing?
Sammi, Sammi, come on.
Give me that sneaker. Sammi.
Hey, Lar, you ever hear of Denta Friend? that would really get rid of your plaque.
What are you talking about, get rid of my plaque? I don't have plaque.
My cousin's hygienist told me you had plaque.
Your cousin's hygienist told you I have a lot of plaque?
What's the big deal?
Plaque is not a serious disease.
I don't have any plaque.
That's a breach of patient and hygienist confidentiality.
There is no patient and hygienist confidentiality. like a doctor or a lawyer, but it's unethical is what he's saying.
It's totally unethical.
And I don't have any plaque.
Tell him I don't have any plaque.
Did you tell him that?
Challenge me, just like you do in golf.
I've got a tip that will save your game. Change it.
Weatherman gave you a good golf tip?
I played with him two weeks ago and it's changed my entire game.
Sammi.
Sammi.
What is it?
What? What?
What are you leaving stuff out like that for?
She took the mail into my car.
I think we're gonna leave.
We had a great time.
She shouldn't have been going through the papers.
You can go home without your sneaker.
You have more sneakers at home.
Larry.
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.
She could have told me where the sneaker was.
It's not that hard.
In the closet, three words.
How about that?
And how about that hygienist?
It's like, if you go to a prostitute and the prostitute goes around telling everybody you got a small penis.
Not that I've ever been to a prostitute.
Not that I have a small penis.
You plunk down $300 for a hooker, expect her to keep her mouth shut.
I'm only guessing $300.
What do I know? What?
My stomach is killing me.
I am never gonna eat at their house again.
I swear, I don't know what Susie does when she cooks, but it's awful.
The weatherman's on.
By the beaches it is a bit cool, around 70?
But tomorrow's forecast, folks,
I know I'll be watching that Godfather trilogy.
Jennifer, Stu, back to you.
Come on, it's gonna rain.
He's only saying it's gonna.
We don't know for sure.
He's only saying?
It's his job. It's gonna rain.
No, I'm gonna stay home with Sammi. and I just think it'd be better if I stayed home with her tomorrow.
He's not right all the time, you know?
Well, he's right most of the time.
What?
What happened,
Larry?
I fell in the toilet.
What's wrong?
My back, oh.
What a lousy night's sleep.
Man. Cheryl, it's beautiful out.
Jeff canceled golf because the weatherman predicted rain.
Predicts rain, doesn't rain.
It's not the first time this has happened.
I don't like that weatherman.
I'm gonna go to that golf course.
Hey, Chuck.
Hey, how's it going,
Larry?
Not bad.
How's it looking out there?
It's wide open, man.
Hardly anybody out there.
You know what?
Probably does.
Huh. there he is with Dr. Funkhouser, coming up on the ninth hole.
Fell in the toilet. because of your weather report about thundershowers.
I don't quite get your point.
All right, weatherman,
I'm gonna tell you my point.
I've got a sneaking suspicion that you're predicting rain to clear the golf course for yourself.
Ridiculous?
Ridiculous?
It's happened before, weatherman.
You know it.
You know what?
I'm calling the weather people on you.
You're gonna report me because it's a nice day?
I'm gonna report you because every time you want to play golf,
I'm not a weatherman,
I'm a meteorologist.
Can you guys just calm down?
We're in the middle of a game.
There's a low pressure system sitting out over the coast.
The jet stream brings that into this area.
The jet stream is controlled by the rotation of the earth. of bullshit coming out of your mouth.
You're busted.
Yeah, Dr. Funkhouser,
I'd appreciate it next time, don't roll up my sleeve if I request you not to.
It's not clinging to the wrist the way it's supposed to.
Fine, okay.
You know what?
The barn's on fire.
The barn's on fire.
I'm turning you in, weatherman.
Hey, Larry, what happened to you, buddy?
Fell in the toilet.
What do you mean?
Cheryl left the toilet seat up.
I fell in.
Hey, you know, it's good that I ran into you.
Mary and I were talking this morning, and, uh, what we decided to do is we're gonna go ahead and board
I know you offered to take care of her, but, uh,
I just think it's better to put it into a kennel.
It's a small dog.
Wouldn't be much fun anyway.
I was kind of looking forward to it. I like dogs.
Yeah yeah.
But I really appreciate the offer. I do.
Thank you.
That was sweet of you.
I talked to her this morning.
I had to apologize for not being at the party last night.
Yeah, she was kind of miffed that we didn't call.
We were supposed to be there, but why?
I'll see ya.
Yeah, see ya.
All right.
What happened to you?
I went to go pee and the seat was up.
When you get up during the night you don't have to turn the light on and wake up.
If I pee 20 times during a day,
When you're peeing all over your shoe,
What makes you think
I'm peeing over my shoe?
Just get my sneaker. and close the door.
Get this, the weatherman is a total fraud.
I just came from there, he's playing with your cousin.
You crap standing up?
By the way, you left last night.
You were about to give me the weatherman's tip
He just called me and said,
Don't give it to Larry.
What an asshole.
The fuck happened to you?
Cheryl got nauseous from your dinner last night and she left the toilet seat up, and then I went to pee and fell in the toilet.
Yeah, he called to see how the party went.
I didn't need to.
I'll get your sneaker.
Marty, let me ask you a question.
Does your father have good Hodgkin's?
Oscar ate it.
The good news is, folks, that wonderful weather we've been enjoying all week in the whole
Los Angeles basin, that's going to continue tonight and all day tomorrow, Saturday.
If you're going to the Leo Funkhouser testimonial, I'll see you there.
We're gonna have a wonderful day and Leo, nobody deserves this more.
But the bad news is, we have a cold weather front that's gonna push in around midnight Saturday night.
We're gonna have thundershowers all day Sunday and they're gonna continue all the way into Monday.
Folks, don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger. All right, back to you.
I'm not dressed appropriately for this.
Okay.
What for?
Yeah, everybody's wearing a name tag.
No, it has nothing to do with that.
It's my jacket.
If I put this on, it's gonna leave little paper remnants.
It's on. You're gonna go celebrate with everybody else.
Come on, let's just go inside, okay?
What do you say?
It'll be fine.
It's not very nice suede anyway.
Okay.
Did you have any idea it was gonna be this big?
Here's our table.
Why don't you switch? Nobody's gonna notice. I don't know these people.
Excuse me, what are you doing?
Making sure the placecards are where they're supposed to be.
You're supposed to be at this table, yeah.
No no no. I don't have a problem.
Where'd you get this from?
I floss probably more often than anybody in this room.
I didn't grow up dreaming of doing this.
I even thought about.
Well, if it isn't the old reliable weatherman.
Yeah, exactly what I did.
I got a little tip for you,
Expect to find a little company tomorrow on the golf course.
Bring a raincoat. It's gonna thundershower all day tomorrow.
It's not gonna work tomorrow, buddy.
Well, this is a great day, as you all know, here at Rolling Valley
Country Club. 35 years ago to this date, my father Leo Funkhouser joined this club.
And at the time, we were the first and only Jewish family.
And today we still are, but we love this place.
It's great to see all your faces here, and this is a very special day for all of us.
It's usually after the fact.
Look at that.
That's it, that's the end of the jacket.
When I was three years old, he couldn't do it anymore cause I was taller than he was.
What a great day.
There's not a lot I can say.
Leo, right now, as you all know, has retired.
My mom couldn't be here tonight, of course.
Excuse me.
Can you keep it down a little bit?
Cause it's loud.
I have to translate for my husband.
He doesn't understand.
I understand, but just be a little quieter, that's all.
Yeah, drink your tea or coffee.
I'm trying to hear what your cousin has to say.
Yeah, shut your mouth.
You can see your plaque.
What did he say? Shut my mouth?
I don't have any plaque.
At least I don't hide my baldness with a yarmulke.
He'll show it to you if you'll show him glasses.
Tell him he don't touch my glasses.
Larry, okay. Larry.
Ow, I hurt my back again.
Let's bring the roof down for my father,
Leo Funkhouser.
Larry, get up.
I can't.
I hurt my back.
I hurt my back.
I hurt my back.
I hurt my back.
It had to freaking rain.
Okay, that's enough.
Larry.
You've been doing your homework.
I mean, was I there too, or?
Pas de bour?e's are really tough.
Pas de bourr?e's are the toughest thing.
It'll get easier.
Yeah.
I mean, I'll get it.
You know what? I get ideas all the time about mixed nut packages.
Like, I'll see a mixed nut package, I'll think, what would I want to put in a mixed nut?
I have my own ideas about that.
You know, it's kind of like everyone has their idea of what would be the best combo.
Come on, you must get people on the street come up and pitch you story ideas and stuff.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Your chemistry together is fierce.
You're embarrassing me.
Stop it, no.
Look at this,
Yes, let's check these out.
There's only four cashews in here. balance is askew.
Fine, two packages. You know what?
I gotta get out of this place.
Hey, Broadway.
I'm glad it's going well. for those
Thank you.
I didn't know what to get and Cheryl said it might be nice.
And the dental hygienist called.
Hm, I wonder what she wants.
Well.
Get together?
You and me?
Cause, when you were at the office, you gave me the tongue sign.
Tongue sign?
Pfft.
Why me?
I don't know. You remind me of my college history teacher.
Was he an avuncular bald Jew?
She calls me just out of the blue.
Out of the blue.
It's all set up.
It's all set up for next Thursday.
Wow.
Can I do this?
Is it wrong?
You'll never get another opportunity like this for the rest of your life.
You have to do this. It's a gift from your wife. She wants you to do it.
It's my 10th anniversary present.
It's your 10th anniversary present.
I can do it.
At first I thought it was my imagination, but you're talking really gay.
Fierce? Where does fierce come from?
And everything is this and that.
You've become Steve the gay choreographer.
What are you doing throwing all that shit on the ground?
Mel told me.
Hey, I forgot to ask you, wanna play golf on Saturday
I don't think you'll be playing golf with Marty Funkhouser this Saturday.
I thought he had the good Hodgkin's.
How do you know?
What's your proof?
I'm gonna tell you how I know, okay?
I used to watch
Party of Five, right there.
I wouldn't be going around quoting good Hodgkin's based on Party of Five.
All right. What is that?
Is that Swedish, Sven?
It's Norwegian.
Sven was a Swedish name.
It's not. 'Cause I don't look
Swedish, do I?
It's a big difference.
Apparently.
What's the difference, may I ask?
Culture, looks, names, history, food, dancing.
Are Swedes touchy if you refer to them as Norwegians?
Yeah.
There's like four cashews in a whole bag, you know?
See?
I didn't save it. I'm going to the funeral, I need a snack actually.
They're very good.
They're delicious cashews, but would it kill him to put three more cashews in there?
That's because you're not in the industry.
I would call it raisins.
And then let people be surprised by the cashews.
You're not serious, are you?
We could put more in there, but they'd charge you a lot more.
That's the balance. We wanted to make an affordable snack.
I'll be a happy man.
Then I think you got the right ratio.
That's all.
No big deal.
Should we just rehearse?
Can we get started?
Hey.
Hey.
Look at this.
Letter from the club.
I didn't get one.
If I don't clean it, they're gonna suspend me.
Terrible, yeah.
What do you eat those things for?
No, I have no appetite.
I got a letter from the club about having a dirty locker.
They don't like dirty lockers. maybe, if you had anything to do with that?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
He was a great man.
Sure you don't want to give me that weatherman's tip?
Right now
I'm in mourning.
We'll talk about it.
What's with the open casket?
I know, why do we have to go look at that?
Hey, Jeff Rosenthal.
He was a writer on Party of Five.
Go ask him.
Excuse me.
Did you work on Party of Five?
Yeah.
You remember the season when Charlie had Hodgkin's?
Right.
Well, he had Hodgkin's that he survived.
I don't know if that's good.
But isn't there a good Hodgkin's and a bad Hodgkin's?
No, there's Hodgkin's and nonHodgkin's lymphoma.
And Hodgkin's disease has a better survival rate.
I mean, that's a valid point, but I wouldn't say it was good.
Better.
Okay, there's two kinds of Hodgkin's.
One has a better survival rate than the other.
No, it's not good.
Well, it's better than the other.
Okay, better, but it's not good.
Compared to the other, it's good.
Sven must have put my club in there, probably on purpose.
Because I like the way mine feels.
Your club, I can get at any store in the country. be buried in eternity with my club? That's not fair.
That's not fair.
I'll buy you a new club today.
The exact same one.
And it better have the same feel.
My Uncle Leo was more than my uncle, he was like a second father to me.
And he loved life, my Uncle Leo.
Didn't he?
He was a guy who lived it to the hilt.
He loved a good walk. on ice with the fizz.
A short nap
He loved to frame the answers
Every second Tuesday, a haircut.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to my Uncle Leo.
Marty, come here a minute.
What is that?
We are kicked out of our country club because of
You didn't know the golf club had your name on it?
Fucking idiot.
What are we supposed to do now, all right?
Where's Cheryl gonna play tennis?
I've been playing at that club for years.
She's in the tournaments. She's one of the best players in the club.
She's not that great.
Matter of fact, I am and I think I proved that.
And you're still hanging onto that.
You know how many times I've played tennis since? You know what?
The truth of the matter is
Cheryl cares about that club,
I care about that club,
Sammi goes to day camp there with the same kids she's been with for years.
You two don't give a shit about anybody but yourself.
You're fucking narcissists, okay?
It's all a game, all a big fucking game.
You don't think about what's gonna happen next.
You know what?
I would rather be out of that club
We've no place to go, no place to play.
Okay, you know what?
I think my friend Julie was just saying that the Beverly Park Country Club might be taking new members.
And it's a beautiful country club.
All right, I don't want to offend you, but there's, like, three fucking Jews in the whole club.
It's not for us.
It's WASP, WASP, Republican city.
Okay, you know what?
I fit in with you guys all the time.
How am I gonna get by in the interview?
Hey, fuck you, Larry.
I didn't get us into this predicament.
We get an interview, we go in there.
You have to walk on that course.
There's no carts.
It wouldn't hurt you to walk a little, Jeff.
That's what it's all about.
You can't exercise a little bit?
I'd have to get a doctor's note in order to take a cart.
Oskie.
Hey, Oskie.
Come on.
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Should I sit?
Yeah.
The dog bit my penis.
He's never bitten anybody before, ever.
It's not the first time with you and the dog. I know that.
What does that mean?
What happened with the dog?
Dog was in his lap.
He got up, he had a boner.
Why did the dog give you an erection?
And why didn't you tell me about that?
First of all, that's not true, okay?
I was petting the dog, and then the dog left
No, because I just had to adjust my pants.
Nothing, I was just petting it.
You see what you did?
Okay, let me see.
I just got this.
High blood pressure, eczema, anything like that?
Are you in
The Producers?
Steve, the choreographer for The Producers.
Anthony?
Yes.
Yes. He mentioned me, then?
He's told me a lot about you, actually.
I golf too.
That's the only reason
Well, I'll go all day if you let me.
Why don't you give me Mister Baggie and just stand up and show me what the dog did?
And he says to you,
You got it out there,
By the way, gentlemen,
I'm not too worried about the global warming.
People like it a little warmer, don't they? where did you go to school?
New Haven.
I went to Yale.
It's sort
I don't know if you've noticed.
I wouldn't say December.
No, we met at a fundraiser.
Just volunteering our time and our effort.
Good for you.
Because when you're young, you have the energy and the power to do those things.
But now, that's the interesting question,
That's a good question.
Magnificent, really.
Just magnificent.
Quite comfortable.
Let me say the golf course is magnificent too,
I got hit with a mallet in the head and fell off the horse, and unfortunately my polo days are over.
But I found the swing really works for golf.
You know, that's right.
It is a similar swing.
It's a similar swing.
Think about it, yeah.
By the way, did I notice in the parking lot?
Was that you?
Did you let that one in, Ken?
I thought we did.
Let me ask you a question.
That's a fair question.
Outside of golf of course,
Got a schooner down at the marina.
A schooner in the marina?
That's marvelous. or do you have a captain?
Occasionally I'll bring a captain in if it's windy.
Could I ask you a few more questions
Well,
What other organizations are you members of?
We're on the Council for Conservative Citizens, we're in the Heritage
Foundation.
I think this has gone rather well.
We've enjoyed meeting you. unfortunately because of my polo accident,
I'm not able to walk the course and I'll have to take a cart.
Dr. Anthony Parker. but I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight.
Why not?
A dog bit my penis.
A beautiful Sunday, we're sitting here like idiots.
We should be playing golf.
Should we try going to a public course?
On a Sunday it'd be a long wait.
When do you think I'm gonna hear from the new club?
I thought mine went great too.
I don't know what to do without golf.
When I'm done with this paper,
You wanna get the violin out?
Another thing, I'd love to get to this
Dodger game tomorrow night.
Everybody at Dodger Stadium, from top to bottom, nobody's got tickets.
I know.
I wanna go too.
It's too bad we got kicked out of that golf club.
His father just died.
He's probably not even going.
It is weird to ask a guy, you know his father just died,
Huh.
Still,
What do you do, just call him up and say, Hey?
I feel your grief, but are you gonna use those tickets?
There's no good way to go about it, none.
You know every Sunday he has brunch over at Nat's.
We just say hello, we happen to run into him.
Let's get breakfast.
Maybe we'll run into him, say hello. We'll feel it out, check him out.
Zip in, zip out, say hello.
If the subject of baseball comes up, it comes up, that's all.
Ah, see him?
See him?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's tougher than
I thought, but hopefully
Look what's going on here.
Do me a favor, call me back and we'll play maybe.
Bye.
Good to see you guys.
We were talking about it,
I thought I'd try it out.
I always order the turkey.
Little turkey action today.
I just can't eat today.
I've lost five lbs. in two days.
I have no appetite.
By the way, you know,
I'd just like to apologize again
You know that.
You've seen me hit that club.
We interviewed.
We're waiting to hear.
It's gonna be tough, it should be a great game.
No, I decided
I'm gonna go.
He would have wanted me to go.
Hey, if you're a little lonely, you need a little companionship at the game, if you want me to keep you company,
I'd be happy to do it.
I don't have a seat for you.
Hmm.
Okay.
Hey, you know what?
No dropping out.
The tip, remember the weatherman's tip?
The statute of limitations has gotta be up on that, no?
You're still asking about the golf tip?
Forget it.
Hey hey.
You, wearing that old Seinfeld jacket?
I'm trying to get out of jury duty today.
I'd do it, but I'm in the middle of rehearsals for The Producers.
That can help you get out of jury duty?
They hate people in the entertainment industry.
And they'll look at the Seinfeld jacket
All right.
Hello, look who's here, my beautiful wife.
She looks very familiar.
I'm glad
I caught you.
It's hard to get out of these things.
I don't know what,
Yeah, I don't think you get to choose.
I can't serve under another foreman.
That's not gonna work.
No, and then what are you doing?
Would you rather go to the game?
I got you tickets.
What, are you kidding me?
Where did you get these from?
But just trust me, they're good.
I got you two tickets.
That's pretty high up in the alphabet.
Go with Jeff. I know you guys were working on tickets.
Okay.
What are you doing,
TV Guide crossword puzzle?
Yeah. Tell you the truth,
All right, look,
I've told you 10 times already.
Is that bad? Why should you be in pain like that?
Just do it.
If I get it, will you do it?
I don't know how I'm gonna get it, but I'm gonna get it for you, okay?
If you'll do it with me.
I'm not gonna have any, but you will.
All right, right.
Ms. Whitaker, have you ever served on a jury before?
No.
Have you ever been the victim of a crime?
No.
Is there any reason you can think of that you would not be able to decide this case
Moving on,
Your Honor.
Could you state your name, sir?
No.
Have you ever been the victim of a serious crime?
My cousin once stole an Almond Joy from me.
I don't think that would be considered a serious crime.
I don't know if I could be impartial, Mr Condon, given that the defendant is a Negro.
Problem?
What exactly were you thinking of?
Yeah, I got it.
I got it, yeah, you know.
Yeah, no,
Create the illusion that we're friends talking here, all right?
You kidding me?
You know what?
You're 100 percents right.
That's too much, all right, that, yeah.
Okay, you're doing fine.
Just chill out.
Let's play it safe.
I'll give you an ounce of schwag.
Is that a fair price you're quoting me there, sir?
Look, you can pay me $200 bucks or go fuck yourself.
Look, I don't need to sell the drugs, the drugs'll sell themselves.
No, no, Schwag, $200, okay, I got it.
All right, take out the $200 bucks.
Your hand is on it.
Just walk, just walk, just walk.
Jesus Christ.
I gotta go this way.
Just go, just go.
Aw, you should see the traffic.
The only thing moving is the carpool lane.
I'll never make it.
I'm just gonna go home.
I'm not gonna use the carpool lane by myself.
I don't want to.
That's the difference between you and me.
All right, goodbye.
Hey, Daddy.
You wanna date with Mama?
Get in the car.
A little lollipop love?
A little digging for diamonds?
See, actually, I'm not really interested in any sex, per se.
What?
Five hours it'll be.
You just want me to sit in the car?
All right, $1,000. $1,000. What, are you kidding me?
Exactly, I can give four blowjobs an hour.
I drove a cab, used to drive around for two hours. I couldn't get a fare.
You're getting four blowjobs in an hour?
Yes, honey, you done picked up the best.
Honey, I got a red snapper that talks to you.
You know what it's saying?
I'm charging way too much. $750 and take me to the game.
I'm going to the game then.
I can't take you to the game, Monena.
Listen, you're unhappy.
I'm unhappy too.
That's what a good compromise is all about.
Are you familiar with Henry Clay?
No, I don't know no Henry Clay.
What'd he say?
He was the Great Compromiser.
This is a good compromise. is when both parties are dissatisfied and I think that's what we have here.
Boy, look at this.
We are really zipping along here.
I'm gonna make this game.
That's two tickets.
I'm meeting a friend there actually.
No, I'm gonna go to the game or you're gonna take me back to the corner or I'm gonna call my motherfucking pimp. How 'bout that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Let's go to the game.
Ow, baseball. I ain't never been to no baseball game. This gonna be cute.
Make yourself presentable.
You know you're gonna have to feed me.
I want two hot dogs, a bag of peanuts and a milkshake.
Hey, don't put your wallet away 'cause you know I'm gonna get hungry again.
I know the seats ain't way the fuck up here.
You got a problem with the seats?
You said we had good seats, club seats and shit.
We're way the fuck up.
Shit.
There are a lot worse things you could be doing.
Charge.
What you looking at?
My friend Marty Funkhouser sitting next to an empty seat.
That's better.
Okay.
All right, yeah.
All right, yeah.
Two guys who interviewed me for this golf club.
You know what?
I gotta get out of here.
If I'm not back, I'll meet you at the car after the game.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Batting for the Atlanta Braves, the catcher, Javy Lopez.
Ball one, all right, three more of those and we force one in.
Hey, what a great game, huh?
Why not?
Your father's dead.
It's a memorial.
We used to go to games together.
It makes me feel close to him.
Home run, yeah.
Are you nuts?
Thanks.
You did, you did.
There you go.
You're a sport.
We gotta go out more often, really.
I gotta pay you back.
Yeah, you don't give a shit.
That was good.
Larry, Larry, come here a minute please.
One second.
What a shame.
And I know it's on the way.
Can you give me a lift, please?
Hey, Leo, why don't you give him a push?
It was emotion.
Just give me a ride.
Let's not go through this, please.
There's one little problem.
I'm with a prostitute.
My eyes are closed.
I'll sit in the back, do what you want.
I buy it. Just give me a lift to the airport, please.
All right,
I'll tell you what,
But I want the weatherman's golf tip.
That's the only thing
I can't do.
Forget everything you've ever thought about golf.
Thanks a million for the ride.
I gotta go.
Keep driving around and around.
Hey, do me a favor,
Just hold on to my jacket when I use the bathroom.
Why don't you bring it in there?
Where am I gonna put it?
What if they don't have hooks?
It's not my marijuana.
I was just holding the jacket.
What are you doing?
This isn't even my jacket.
It doesn't even fit me.
Get your hands off of me.
Easy.
Get that dog away from me.
Marty got arrested for marijuana.
I asked him to hold my jacket and there was marijuana in the pocket.
You had marijuana in your pocket?
I bought it for my father for his glaucoma.
I bought it this afternoon and I forgot, I completely forgot.
You don't need no damn marijuana.
I got the best shit in town.
There's cops all over the place here.
You don't even know what the fuck schwag is.
Have you ever bought it before?
This is chronic, okay? It's gonna clear your daddy's eyeball problem and shit.
Okay?
I don't quite have enough cash to pay you tonight.
But I'm, you know,
I'm totally good.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
Tomorrow? This ain't motherfucking pussy on layaway.
You better take your little in there to the motherfucking
I can't 'cause I went to
I already took out $500.
There's a limit.
I am not fucking around with you.
You know how much money you owe me?
I'll tell you what
I'll do with you, okay?
You're dragging me around all day and ain't paid me nothing.
I took you to a baseball game tonight.
None of that good shit. We sat up in them fucked up seats way up there.
Yeah yeah, which you proceeded to blow.
Hey.
I was just about to go to bed.
I got the stuff.
Yeah.
You light it up.
You go like this.
Hold it inside.
I'll leave this here.
No, I don't have that kind of cash.
Wait wait wait, let me put this away.
You tripping.
This is Monena.
She's a friend of Cheryl's.
Look, sweetie, we brought you a little eye medicine.
This your dad?
We gonna hook you right up.
Little Daddy got the little eye problem.
Yeah, this is a joint.
Very good, Daddy.
Chronic.
You want to go sit down and smoke it?
She's a lot of fun.
You two, you two go sit and smoke.
No no no, I want you to do it too, you know?
You have to do it too.
That's right, this is Bubonic Chronic.
No, no more, no more.
I want to tell you what this is.
You're crazy.
I wonder what it is to smoke bad shit.
Just say this.
Dis chronic is the shiznik.
Yiddish to me.
Yiddish Ebonics.
Yeah yeah, you holding on too long.
Look at that.
He blew the scene.
Gei kucken ahfen yam.
Gei kucken ahfen yam.
How about
He's a meshuggener?
Meshuggener?
What's that, Ebonics too?
What are you looking at?
Huh?
What did I do?
You know what you did.
You did nothing.
You gotta change the diet.
I told you about that.
I don't want the red meat. You're eating the red meat. I don't like that.
I'm doing the best I can.
Go to a doctor. Get yourself a checkup. Colonoscopy.
Are you afraid to get a colonoscopy?
What's the matter with you? gonna do it.
And you know,
I love him too.
He is my boy.
Fucking faggot. coming up. You gonna get a card?
You're not gonna do a fuckin' thing.
I'll try and do better, I will.
TV TV TV, that's all you like to do.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
This stuff?
I can see.
You're kidding me.
Really?
It's a miracle.
It's a hooker.
All you have to do, Larry, is get up there and tell the truth.
It was Larry's jacket, it was Larry's grass. for your father's glaucoma.
You know, you could be a little more grateful.
Why didn't you tell me there was grass in the jacket?
Guys, I just need you to be earnest.
The judge has to find you a credible witness.
Where is my jacket, by the way?
Who gives a shit about your jacket?
I'm sure you can get another one.
You know I know the way out.
You said five hours and it was seven, honey.
You still owe me $200.
I want my 200 skrilla.
I want my money, baby.
I need my skrilla.
All rise for the Honorable
Judge George Nagel.
Is that the judge?
Well, Mr David, what do you have to say for yourself?
Puffy shirt, puffy shirt.
Can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?
You know, it's really
Don't answer it.
I don't want to talk to her.
I'm not here.
Hello?
I swear, it gets better every time I see it.
I can't believe this woman has to call after every single show.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I'm getting my physical for The Producers.
Can you do me a favor?
A gift for a baby?
Get a doll for Betty.
It's her baby shower.
Well, what about the surrogate?
Get her anything?
I don't think you need to worry about the surrogate.
Well, I don't know about that.
She's having the baby.
The shower is for Betty.
She's gonna be opening her presents.
The surrogate's standing there like an idiot and has nothing to open?
What's the surrogate etiquette?
Okay, use your judgment, whatever you think.
If that's what you want to do, that's fine.
Hey, Charlie, what's going on there?
Ah, what? What?
Come on, you know
I can't do anything.
Because the dog bit your penis?
Yes.
It's not ready.
I'm not ready.
A couple more days.
Mr David?
Can I make an observation?
Well, the doctor's ready to see you.
Okay.
Just, you know, just for your information,
FYI kind of thing.
What are you doing, stealing your magazines from garbage cans?
I have never seen such a collection of shit in my life.
They're all four years old, those things.
We have other things that we think about other than the magazines, like giving people medical assistance.
Ladies Home Journal from 2001.
People magazine.
Tom Cruise is 40.
Wow.
Yeah, you got a lot of that stuff memorized.
I got the point.
We got it, gotcha.
Get Nation.
How about Nation?
Do you read Nation?
It's a fabulous magazine.
I have read Nation.
That's a good one.
How you feeling?
Unfortunately, I can't give you a clean bill of health at this point.
Yeah, I don't know what happened.
There was a little, slight abnormality.
We were going along great, and you kind of spiked a little there.
And I can't sign the form for you.
Believe me, there's nothing wrong with me. I'm fine.
Jack, I'm fine.
Trust me, I'm fine.
Here's what we're gonna do.
It's simple, come on.
There's no irregularity.
Yes, there is, Larry.
I went to medical school.
I'm gonna give you a device called a heart halter.
This is ridiculous.
Larry, I have to do it.
I have to do it.
It straps on, a couple of electrodes.
You wear it for 24 hours.
It measures your heartbeat.
You come back and if this was an abnormality, an aberration, the device will confirm it.
You get back on the treadmill for five minutes,
I sign the slip, and you're off to Broadway.
Do you have the halter?
You want to give that to Larry?
I'm gonna schedule you for an appointment tomorrow.
Will you take off your jacket, Larry?
Great.
It's really easy.
There we go.
There you go.
That's it.
There.
I got to tell you what happened last night.
Yeah, I just saw her at Dr. Jack's.
Look, have you ever made it
Yes. Twice.
What, the same one twice?
Two different ones.
This woman's extraordinary.
A couple of months ago
I went to a Knicks game.
And I went into the locker room to say hello to some of my friends.
They were showering and I looked.
I saw one of the forwards.
And he threw the towel off.
He was getting dressed, and I looked down.
Big? They could put the Chicago fire out with this.
Well, he's a big guy.
He's a forward.
You need to see a guard.
Did you see a guard?
You can't tell by a forward.
They're too big, out of proportion.
I don't care.
I could see how it could be a concern.
I don't know whether I would ever want to have intercourse with her, because I'm a little intimidated.
And you're one of the few friends I can tell this to.
Okay, well, then maybe
I got that 10th anniversary present.
A good friend doesn't do that.
Why? It would be a nice 10th anniversary present for me.
I'd rather go to Tiffany's and get you a bowl.
I don't want a bowl.
All right.
Here you go.
It is possible for black people to have other jobs.
No no,
I know, of course.
Yeah.
Get my car, boy.
I saw it, Larry.
He had on a white shirt and a red tie and a vest.
He's standing by the valet sign.
Anytime I see a black man in a tie and a suit,
I think, Hey, you must park cars for a living.
I feel it was an honest mistake, Wanda.
No no, if it was a white man standing here, you would not.
I would have given him the valet. I would too.
How's the filming going?
It's good.
I'm shooting over there.
On my little break.
Let me ask you a question.
You've slept with a lot of white men and black men, I'm sure.
Let me rephrase that.
Let me rephrase that.
Yeah, rephrase that.
My friend wants to know.
Why, what's the big deal?
I am not gonna answer that.
What is that? What the fuck?
What are you doing?
It's a bug, a bug.
I had a bug on me.
Look, did you get my script to that guy, that Martin Schaffer?
Everything's okay since you want your little favor.
I gave it to him.
He'll read it and get back to you.
He's not gonna rewrite it, is he?
I need a black man to get my car.
Is there a black man in the area who wants to take my valet ticket?
Is this the only doll?
Yeah, that's the only one left.
For black and white couples?
They make a doll for their kids?
I don't know.
See what
I'm getting at?
Yeah.
Hmm, I wonder if you do.
Okay. Um, well, I guess 'll take it.
Thank you.
You made it.
No, I'm fine.
What does that mean?
The doctor wouldn't sign off.
Doesn't Bernie look like Steve Demarco?
He looks exactly like him.
They don't look anything alike.
It's a mulatto.
No good? biracial is what we call it, usually.
Biracial. Hmm, what do you know about that?
They gave us another one, too.
That's actually for the surrogate.
Oh.
Cause that's it.
That's all the gifts.
Thank you guys for coming.
What?
You're the one carrying the baby. That's your baby.
You know, like for example,
I got this friend.
She said, Don't let him touch my baby, you know. That's what they do.
You never see it again.
You've lost complete contact with your baby.
You never see the baby again, and it's your baby.
And they give it to another writer.
And that writer doesn't let you even look at your baby.
That's part of your job.
That's what you signed up for.
Maybe in a few years you can see how your script's doing.
Yeah, I know, but then it's all changed.
You have nothing to do with it.
No way out.
It was shocking, outrageous, insulting, and I loved every minute of it.
How are you?
How are you?
Hey.
I am thoroughly impressed.
Yes, surprisingly good.
Still on the book? You don't have it under your belt yet?
Funny you should mention that.
Yeah, I know.
Every time you work, he always has the scripts?
Yes, every time.
I'll be fine. I have a little problem memorizing stuff.
Did you guys get your test results back?
The insurance company's been bugging me.
Yes yes, yeah yeah,
I got mine. Here.
Clean bill of health, flying colors I might add.
I'm proud of you.
Where's your little paper?
What the hell is that?
What is that?
I'm fine, I'm fine. I just didn't pass the physical, that's all.
Are you too old for this?
Is that what he said?
No, I'm not too old for it, believe me. It was a fluke.
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me. he's winded.
You wanna race me?
Put your sneakers on.
Let's stop being juvenile.
You can't win. Let's not race him.
Now look, folks.
Excuse me. Hey, Dad.
You don't think
I could beat him in a race?
I got the pictures from Spain.
She comes in that room again tomorrow when I take the test,
I look at the ceiling.
I can tell you that.
Okay, that's great.
All right, I think you're gonna be fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm fine. Did I just spit on you?
No no, I always do that.
You're always rubbing your face I noticed.
Victor McLaglan and Adolphe Menjou,
Gypo, Gypo Nolan, remember from The Informer?
Gypo Nolan.
Excuse me.
Can I introduce you to my dad?
My dad's a huge fan.
This is Irving.
Irving Schwimmer, pleasure to meet you.
Yes, pleasure meeting you.
I'm looking forward to seeing your show.
I've been a fan of yours for years.
I appreciate that. Would you guys excuse me for one minute?
Yeah yeah yeah.
You finally got to meet him.
Dad, this is Larry.
Hi, how you doing?
Nice to meet you.
Well, I'd better be taking off, okay?
Are those genitals?
What is that on that bull?
All right, Dad.
You told him about the whole
It was your suggestion,
Mr Constructive Criticism.
He's putting four cashews in a bag.
He deserves some constructive criticism.
I don't feel comfortable with you calling my dad.
David, I'm going to apologize.
Just call
This is Irving Schwimmer.
What's your fucking problem, you prick?
Jesus.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
What are you doing?
You think I hit your car?
What are you doing?
What is this?
Is it your heart? All right, just calm down. Don't take them off.
You shouldn't have took them off.
I don't know CPR.
Call an ambulance.
Call 911.
Send 'em to the park, come on.
Oh.
Hang in there. Can you breathe?
Keep breathing, all right?
Whatever you do, don't stop breathing. Keep doing that.
You got a phone?
I faked the whole thing.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
This is ridiculous.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Seriously.
That's a myth? Boy, too bad for the black guys.
I know. I know.
I speak from both sides.
Get out of town.
I bought a mulatto doll today.
I was wondering about that, if that was a bad one.
Yeah, it's a bit outdated.
Hey, this is Masasa.
Hi, I'm Cheryl.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs David, it was lovely meeting you.
And good luck to you and your friend.
It was a road rage incident, and a guy came out of his car with a tire iron.
You did what?
No, I'm fine.
Then why am I here?
Why are you in a hospital bed right now?
What are you talking about?
Weird guy had a tire iron.
He was gonna kill me.
You're in the hospital.
If you're calling me to rush over to help you,
You'd rather come in here and see me with broken limbs?
Well, I'd rather not come in here and see you chatting with the nurse.
I'm not allowed to talk to a nurse?
You're having a good time in the hospital.
Is that what you wanted?
You would prefer that?
By the way, what did you say to the surrogate?
She's gone into labor.
She's here at the hospital, and she's not gonna give the baby up.
What did you tell her?
She said she had a talk with you.
I didn't say anything.
That's a quote?
That's a quote.
Those bastards.
The fourth time I've been here, and I still can't get this colostomy bag to fit. It doesn't fit.
And the insurance company won't pay for it.
It's full all the time.
I don't understand why they just don't take care of it.
What are you doing?
You can't keep that baby.
I was talking about a script.
She's biracial.
Bi, what do you mean biracial?
They don't say mulatto anymore.
She got mad at me.
That's fantastic.
Look at that.
Look at that.
I'm gonna see Renee this afternoon.
Did I tell you that
Bernie Dusenberry's gonna kick my ass?
Did I mention that?
Hey.
Yes.
I won't shake your hand.
I'm in a bathroom.
One of the great guards of all time.
Go ahead, do your thing.
What the fuck?
Why are you looking at my dick?
You crazy?
You okay?
Are you all right?
Think I'm gonna steal your car?
No no, it's just
I forgot to just put the alarm on.
It's not you.
It's no race thing.
No, no race thing.
Asshole.
No, I don't even need the alarm on.
It's off. I turned the alarm off, look.
Black man, no suit, he gonna steal your car.
I can't do anything in this city without you watching me, following me?
I told you I'm shooting here all week.
He just happened to be there when I turned to put the alarm on.
Let me lock my car.
You put the alarm on.
The black man made you go,
Let me lock the car.
No, I just hadn't done it yet, that's all.
And do you think a black man would want that piece of shit?
Piece of shit, how dare you?
No black man don't want a toy car.
It happens.
Well, did you tell him
I was black?
No.
Why should I?
Larry, you don't know when to play the card.
I mean, you know, white guys, they love that shit.
Helping the black person.
You should know better.
All right, all right,
I'll tell him you're black, okay? Fine. not light skinned.
Make sure he know
I'm real black.
I hope I don't see you for a while.
Getting sick of you.
Take your sick ass in the hospital.
Mr David.
Can I say that this is fantastic, the magazines?
What an improvement, unbelievable.
It's a pleasure.
You know what
I say to you now?
It was the best waiting room experience I've ever had.
I'm seeing right here that you're happy.
Nice job, and did you notice I got Golf?
I saw the Golf.
I picked up a nice tip.
Hey, Larry.
I was able to reschedule his appointment.
Bye, Larry.
And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
She's gonna give the baby to the Dusenberrys after all.
I'm back in business, baby.
I can't do those things.
Don't pick it up.
I'm not talking to her tonight.
This is Irv Schwimmer.
You motherfucking, cocksucking,
Who the fuck do you think you are?
What does it take to be a Girls Gone Wild girl?
Those girls from Cancun are wild.
Yes, they are, but if you want to see how wild they really get, you've gotta get the video.
Palm Pilot?
It's not here, no.
What are you watching?
I thought you were supposed to be taking care of that.
Jeff's got this Indian guy.
I'll take care of it, okay.
I'm watching this thing about hippos.
This is the longest we've gone since we've been married.
It's better, isn't it?
You went off the pill.
I can't use condoms.
First of all,
I'm embarrassed to buy 'em, and I'm not good at it.
Why don't we do this?
I'll call and make an appointment for you to have a vasectomy and then we don't have to worry about this any longer.
I'll get the condoms.
It's not here. It's downstairs.
Don't miss the videos everyone's talking about.
Girls Gone Wild
Ultimate Spring Break on video or DVD
Hey.
What's the matter?
Marvin and I broke up.
I mean, I can't believe it.
Larry, I can't believe it.
How come?
I just don't understand, Larry, why it happened.
I thought we were gonna maybe get married.
What are those,
Mentos?
Mmm.
Boy, that's really good.
That is a hell of a candy, you know that?
How do they get the essence of orange like that?
It's amazing, just with chemicals.
Well, I got a couple of things for you to do.
And I got a corn.
Fill up my car with mints and gum
Okay, cancel lunch, and why?
Yeah.
Anything else?
Well, your mail is here.
Girls Gone Wild,
Larry?
Hey, what are you doing opening my mail?
I thought it was my mail.
I ordered a Pilates video.
Look, it says
Larry David on it.
Well, I was a little distracted.
Anyway it's not for me, it's for Jeff.
Come on.
Girls Gone Wild?
It's supposed to be
College Girls Gone Wild.
College Girls Gone Wild?
Yeah, College Girls
Gone Wild.
Do you know what that does to women?
Terrible, I agree with you.
It's terrible.
Do Jeff a favor and throw that away.
Why the hell does he need this stuff? got you what you need.
Everlast condoms, my friend.
With those babies you're never gonna stop.
How long you think
I'd want to do that for?
All night long,
I would've guessed.
It gets boring, come on.
It's a bore.
No, it doesn't get boring.
What is it?
It's enough, in and out.
These things, by the way, really give me problems anyway.
Come on, they fit me.
Everlast?
All night long.
Thank you for getting them for me.
Remember that Indian you were telling me about?
I'll be glad to give it to you.
But don't say you got it from me.
He's pissed off at me cause Susie doesn't want me to pay him because he went $200 over the estimate.
Hey, what's going on with your gal down the hall there?
I'm having a lot of problems with her.
And frankly, I'd like to do the same.
She knows my dietary habits.
She knows about all my web of lies and bullshit and deceit.
You know what else she knows?
Wow, College Girls Gone Wild.
Look at that.
Auto Focus party?
I got the big screen, we can watch it.
Which character are you gonna be?
You can be the freakish guy.
It's the hottest
Girls Gone Wild video ever.
I can't get used to them.
Yeah, aw, here we go.
Right at the top, they're just doing it right away.
If a guy did that, he'd get arrested. You know that?
They'd throw him in jail, and that would be the end of him. He'd be a pariah for the rest of his life. boobies, all right?
Do you know what a woman would do if I ever asked her to
Why do you have to analyze this? Can't we just watch it?
She would spit on me.
If I ever asked a girl to lift up her top, she would kick me in the balls and spit on me.
We waited a long time to see this.
Now all you're doing is just yacking. Be quiet, come on.
You know what? I gotta,
I can't even see in these glasses.
Well, sit closer.
These bifocals aren't any good, I don't think.
I wanna go to the car and get my other glasses, okay?
I'm not a pauser.
I don't like pausing.
Well, that's rude. I'll miss it.
I'll rewind it when you come back.
But I can see when you rewind
There's no story. Give what away?
Well, why give the bosom away?
Fine.
Hurry up.
Hey, what is that? That's not where we left off.
That's exactly where we left off.
I guarantee you that's not know it.
Oscar?
Did you leave the door open?
Oscar.
Oscar.
Oscar.
I waved to a guy in a Prius and he didn't wave back.
I don't wave to people with the same car as me.
A special breed.
You know what?
I wanna see what's up with that guy.
See what's up with that guy?
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do after you catch him?
Oscar.
He's not bleeding or anything.
Let me see if he can stand.
Come on, stand up, Oskie.
Aw.
What do you want to do?
Should we take him to the vet?
He seems okay.
He actually does seem okay.
All right, we'll go back to the house.
We'll put the video in, watch it and the whole time we'll monitor Oscar.
Yeah, we'll watch the video, and we'll keep an eye on him at the same time.
I'm not saying don't take him to the vet if he needs to.
We'll watch the video and monitor him.
Video and monitor, that's it.
Well, he knows about it.
Good thing he can't talk.
Come on, pal, hop in.
I got news for you.
I don't even think I hit him.
I don't think you hit him, either.
Hey, let's make a pact right now.
If we notice anything wrong while watching, we're gonna stop the tape and take him to the vet.
See, it pays to lay off that sex for a while.
It kind of reminds me of when
Mantle was injured in '63.
He was out for about two months.
Comes back, first at bat, out of the park, home run.
What?
I am completely numb.
Yeah.
I can't feel anything.
Hmm.
I don't know why.
This has never happened before.
I don't know why it would.
What?
I must have put it on inside out.
Inside out? Honestly, you don't know how to put this on?
There's no instructions or anything.
You're the one who wanted to wear the condom.
You didn't tell me you didn't know how to put it on, Larry. Jesus.
I didn't know you could put it on inside out.
Hey, that condom you gave me, Everlast?
I put it on inside out by mistake.
Now Cheryl's all numb in her vagina.
Don't you know how to put a rubber on?
I can't start reading instructions.
How could you have done that?
It was really like squeezing the life out of me.
They're designed to go the other way.
Then you last and you last.
You listen and you listen good.
You keep that trap shut.
Susie's yelling.
I gotta get going.
Cheryl's vagina.
Hey.
How is it?
It feels like it's been shot with novocaine.
Hi, Wandering Bear.
How's it going?
Good.
Okay.
You should just go there and demand that they pay you the money they owe you.
I guarantee you'll get it.
There's an old
Indian saying,
What goes around comes around.
You sure that's Indian?
I thought that was English.
It could apply to anyone.
Hey, Wandering Bear, let me ask you a question.
You know all about plants and herbs and you're kind of a medicine man in a way.
I put a condom on inside out.
And my wife's vagina is completely numb.
Well, I have a pen.
Same thing.
They both perform the same function.
That's true.
Pencil has an eraser.
Is that a Y?
That's a T.
Thank you,
Wandering Bear.
What?
He called my house.
It was kind of embarrassing.
Sure.
At home my machine
Yeah?
I mean clearly he's reaching out, but I shouldn't make the first move, right?
Yeah, you want to get the phone?
Okay, thanks, Larry.
Wandering Bear cured her vagina.
She went to a health food store.
Wandering Bear cures vaginas?
I wish I had special powers over the vagina.
Not good.
Susie took him to the vet.
Did you say anything?
No, I'm not using them anymore.
My doctor told me not to.
He says it's no good for me to keep going and going.
It's not good for my heart.
Wow.
It's a rubber for a young man.
You know what?
You might be right about that.
Okay, that's who it's for.
Hey.
What did the vet say?
Who could that be, I wonder?
Is that what it is?
How come he can't speak?
What's wrong with him?
Who's gonna leave the door open and let him out?
Jeff could have.
Jeff, did you leave the door open?
Hi, Wandering Bear.
Hello.
How is your vagina?
Good.
Wandering Bear just asked me how my vagina is.
Well, I'm sure he just wanted to see if his cure was working.
I don't appreciate strangers asking me about my vagina. God.
He did cure your vagina, did he not?
I don't know how it is with American Indians, but the Jew generally doesn't ask other men's wives about their vagina.
It's a custom thing.
Well, if you take her to the white man doctor, he will not only ask about her vagina, he'll look.
Good point, Wandering Bear, good point.
Anyway, it's really working out.
She's feeling a lot better.
Thanks again.
Hey.
Yeah.
Okay, fine,
I'm terrible.
I'm a bad assistant.
You know,
I don't need this.
Do your own errands, run your own life. about your mom's fake unveiling.
How about that?
Isn't that nice?
And I'm sure Cheryl would love to hear about College Girls
Gone Wild.
Yeah, Cheryl, that's right. College Girls
Gone Wild, Cheryl, it's hot.
You know what? Everybody's gonna know every lie, every deceit, you have ever told, mister.
Eight years of service.
I apologize.
But you can't quit.
Larry?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
She quit. She quit.
She's gonna expose me to the world.
She said she's gonna tell everybody about my lies and my deceit.
What have you said about me?
No no, I didn't mean you.
No, the others.
The others, not you.
But the point is that I'm gonna be ruined, you understand?
She hasn't been fine since she broke up with her boyfriend.
That's the whole problem.
I need to talk to her boyfriend.
I got news for you.
Okay.
I don't understand what happened.
Yeah, you know, she's a great gal.
She really is.
What are you breaking up with her for?
I know.
That's what she said.
Pour it out, buddy.
It's sexual, sexual.
Marvin, I've had every sexual problem known to mankind.
What is it, you're impotent?
I've gone 10 years with no erection.
What is that?
That's not it.
It's not that.
When the race begins,
Quick quick,
I finish quick.
Hmm.
It's tough.
Hmm.
Your problems are over.
Everlast condom?
I've used condoms before,
Larry, they don't help.
You haven't used this one.
I've just got one little word of advice for you.
Don't wear it inside out.
Thanks, Larry.
Yeah, let me go get my jacket.
I'll be right out.
How's Oscar?
He's not good, Larry.
He's not good.
He's the same.
He hasn't gotten any better.
I'll get that.
Yeah, good, go get the door.
Ah, Wandering Bear.
I've come to collect my money.
Wandering Elk, whatever the fuck your name is, you were paid already.
You don't need to talk like that.
We paid you, that was it.
I'd like you out of my house.
You see this?
He's useless.
You see what you did to him?
He's useless.
This used to be a watchdog.
May I take a look at him?
Fine fine, go ahead.
Ahhh.
Hey, Prius.

BloodLogic
I don't know why I ever married this man. What a schmuck.
What the hell are you doing?
Get out here.
You are such schmuck.
Can't you do anything right?
Putz.
Have a good day.
Larry, hmm?
My wife and I are renewing our vows.
Wow. I bet you make her very happy.
No, she's the most miserable woman in the world, believe me.
You're pretty fit,
Larry.
What do you do?
I know you, Larry.
You don't need no ticket.
Okay.
Larry.
I'm all ready for Saturday.
I want to thank you for doing this.
Looking forward to it.
Is that you?
He's my
Yeah.
Terrible.
He was in the building?
No no, he was uptown on 57th Street.
He got hit by a bike messenger.
Yeah. Yeah.
Please. Anything.
I'm a rabbi.
She's almost kind of challenging me in a way, in a kind of demeaning way, she doesn't think I'm suave enough.
It's the only opportunity
I'll have for the rest of my life.
I've never cheated on her,
I never would cheat.
This is all on the up and up.
I'll be honest, it would be nice.
You know what comes to my mind, Larry?
What comes to my mind is the story of Abraham and Sarah.
Sarah could not conceive and said to Abraham,
Go in to your handmaiden Hagar, and have relations with her.
Abraham's wife said that to him?
It's right there in Genesis.
I think that you can look at that as a very real precedent.
This woman's never gonna replace your wife.
It's not an act of love anyway.
And I'm not a bad person if I do it?
No, it does not make you an extra bad person.
I've got to start coming to temple more often.
I'm glad I could be helpful with this.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
You're very welcome.
I'll see you tomorrow night for dinner?
Would it be possible for me to bring him to dinner?
There's no imposition at all.
Bring him over.
That's fine.
Go, enjoy.
Rabbi, thank you.
Okay.
Yes, Your Honor, I do admit for the last 20 years
I've been a lying,
All right?
I'm trying to memorize this stuff, they're making a racket.
You think that's a good idea?
Do survivors like seeing each other?
Do they like to talk about old times or does the sight of another survivor depress them?
I think you should invite him.
I don't know.
How are your vows coming along?
I just haven't had that much time
The whole thing's gonna be embarrassing.
May I always have the wisdom to look past your shortcomings and appreciate all of the goodness you possess.
We'll love each other throughout this lifetime, but after death, through all eternity.
Yeah, that's the idea.
I thought this was over at death.
We finally found each other, Larry, and we're celebrating this for all eternity.
I thought I'd be single,
I guess.
I'm interrupting your single life in eternity?
Well, it does.
No.
Okay.
It's nice meeting you.
This is a treat.
This is really a treat.
Look at you.
You look great.
Do I really need to wear a suit for this?
This is Colby.
Hi, Larry.
Nice to meet you.
He's the survivor.
How is Jerry?
Is he still doing standup?
I just thought you two should meet, you know,
Okay, I'm gonna, uh, say hello to my dad.
Hello. How are you?
Thank you.
A delicious dinner.
I like it,
I like it.
Listen, where is the other survivor?
He's that, uh, tall guy over there.
He's from the television show.
Survivor?
It was harrowing.
I'll tell you that's a very interesting story.
Let me tell you, I was in a concentration camp.
You never even suffered one minute in your life compared to what
I went through.
Look, I'm saying we spent 42 days trying to survive.
We had very little rations, no snacks.
Snacks? What are you talking snacks?
I couldn't even work out.
They didn't have a gym.
It was called the Holocaust.
All I know is I was damned close to that million dollars.
And the whole time, everyone's backstabbing me and undermining me,
You know nothing about survival.
I don't understand.
Why don't you get a sponge?
What? I just told her to get a sponge, that's all.
Are you getting dressed,
Larry?
The rabbi wants to start the ceremony by noon.
My suit's not in the drycleaning.
I can't find it.
No wonder why.
She doesn't give me a ticket.
She doesn't give you a ticket?
You know, she knows me.
I go in there a lot.
I go in there a lot.
She gives me a ticket.
Well then, just wear your black suit, okay?
I got this new suit just for this occasion.
I don't know what to tell you.
If they're closed, they're closed.
You know what?
I always see their van on Ocampo.
I'll bet it's parked in front of their house. you need to go now, all right?
And if not, I'll wear the black one.
You'll wear the black one.
I kind of need a bit of a favor.
You would never disturb me, even if you tried.
How did you know where I live, Larry?
I had seen your van parked outside before.
You've been stalking me, haven't you, Larry?
Well, you know it is the Sabbath.
I cannot drive.
Well, we can walk over there.
You know,
Shlomo is at shul.
Oh.
Do you want to come in for a drink?
Hmm?
Actually, I really don't have that much time.
I kind of got to get going.
Your vows with your wife.
Yes yes.
Yeah. 10 long years.
I'll go get the keys.
What are you doing here?
You should be getting ready. from the drycleaners.
I had to go to her house.
I told her about the 10th anniversary present.
One time. It's on.
Wow. Great.
I spoke to the rabbi.
I have his blessing.
The Hassids, they have sex through a sheet.
Better show up with a sheet or you'll be in big trouble.
Come here for one second.
Come here, come here.
When Hasidim make love, how do they do it?
It's a religious thing that they do.
What do you talk about, how Hasidim have sex?
Help me with the bags, all right?
How do you like that?
I gotta get a sheet.
Know what you should do?
You should spring for a satin sheet.
Really? I don't think that would be good.
You'd be sliding all over.
Beforehand. Show up with the hole beforehand. You gotta do that.
I would think it might be kind of fun cutting the hole with her, sharing it, you know?
Jeff, will you bring in the groceries?
All right, bye.
Larry?
Look, aren't you glad I picked it up?
My mother is very upset right now, and she says she's not coming to the ceremony.
She was just trying to help out.
Then she should've got the sponge.
If she's trying to help, then get the sponge.
Mom.
I love people.
You know what?
Let's just put this behind us, come on.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go to ceremony.
Come on, this is crazy.
A sponge.
Yes, come on.
You're standing two feet from the kitchen.
I've never seen such a car in my life.
It's a beautiful car.
My beautiful
Cheryl,
Larry, congratulations.
Thank you.
Thanks, everybody.
What a pleasure this is here.
Listen, wait till you see these two getting married.
You've got a big affair yet.
What is he doing?
He's mimicking me.
Why are you mimicking me?
No no no, the light from your glass eye, it's reflecting on me. making fun of me.
I don't want to be here.
No more.
Hold it, stop the car.
Just a little bit of Hebrew, and then I will put the glass on the floor and you'll step on it and that'll be it.
That's when everybody yells a matza toff?
No no, it's mazel tov.
It means good luck.
I mean, are we gonna know what you're saying?
I'll translate it.
It's very basic.
Want me to translate?
We love God. Thank you, God.
You're amazing, God.
It's all God.
Well, it's a blessing.
It's more about you than God.
I mean, it's horrifying.
Yeah, I know.
I got a mint.
It's in my pocket.
Do you want me to hand it to you?
It's loose.
It's not in a package.
Or do you want to put your hand in my pocket and get it yourself?
You got three options.
You can do one of those two things or you can refuse it.
Reach into Larry's pocket for an unwrapped mint? Sure.
A loose mint.
You got your mint. Great.
What?
Let's roll?
What did you say?
What? died on September 11th.
With all due respect, wasn't that just a coincidence?
Forget it, forget it.
Do I have to listen to this? Do I have to go on and on and on about this?
I didn't know that an uptown death on West 57th Street was part of the tragedy.
I want to do this.
We came all the way from Florida for this, and we like to get it over with if you don't mind.
What do they say in the Bible?
All right, let's vamoose.
Let's vamoose.
Okay.
And may we continue to love each other unconditionally, not only throughout this lifetime, but after death through all eternity.
I'm drawing a blank here, Rabbi.
I don't have the paper.
You know what?
Just speak from your heart.
Things have been good.
It's pretty good.
I'm not a servant, but I'll certainly help you if you ever need help with anything, you know that.
I'm in the house a lot.
You want to open a bridge table?
Whatever you need.
I'm not a great handyman, and I'm not good at making plans.
That I don't do very well
I have to admit.
She makes the plans.
She makes good plans.
We always have stuff to do.
And I will love you for the rest of my life.
Until the day I die.
I'll love you until death.
That's a pretty good thing.
Not that many women have that.
Right now till the day I die, there will never be any other woman till death.
I promise to love you through all eternity.
All right, eternity.
Hey.
It's about fucking time, Larry.
My God, I've been waiting all day.
Come on in.
I got it stained at the ceremony.
I figured as long as I'm here,
I'd drop it off with you.
Why didn't you take it to the cleaners?
Well, I'm here.
You're a cleaner.
I'm not going to schlep your dirty clothes all the way there. Why should I?
What's the big deal?
Put it in your trunk.
You take it in your fucking car, and you go over to the cleaners.
Not a big deal. You do it all the time.
I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone.
I am not going to schlep your dirty fucking clothes over to the cleaners, Larry.
My God.
You got your work cut out for you with this one.
You come here to fuck or you come here to talk about your dirty suit?
Hmm?
Fuck or suit?
Let's go.
I don't got all day.
All right.
Who brings a sheet to a hotel?
What, do you believe that stupid shit?
It's an earthquake.
Larry. l'm an accountant. l'm from
No, l've come here to do your books.
We went through the whole play, l knew it. Why am l forgetting it all of a sudden?
Maybe l should go with you and run lines with you on the plane. tomorrow, l want you to go to that.
The environment is a lot more important than this show. l want you to do that.
What do you think of my plane outfit?
You like my plane outfit?
Who's gonna be on the plane with you?
Let's see, Jeff, uh,
David Schwimmer, um,
Cady Huffman.
Oh.
No, l know who she is. you don't want me to go.
What?
What? Come on, she hates my guts. l met her at Ben Stiller's party.
She couldn't stand me.
You better work fast, my friend.
Yeah. lf you're gonna cash in on this, uh, you have, what, three days left?
How's it going, by the way? l haven't really been pushing it.
New York's a big place.
This is a good opportunity for you.
The next time l'll see you will be after the play,
Bye.
Go get 'em.
No Cheryl?
No, she's got that
Three days.
You never know.
Hey, Larry.
Mmm.
Hey, where is the coffee place? 1 23 steps that way. 1 23 steps l'll be taking.
Really? l have it too. l'd give you five, but l don't want to touch your hand.
They can really drive me crazy.
What is that,
The Admirals' Club?
Yeah. l'll see you on the plane.
Flight attendants, please prepare for departure.
Thanks for that
Do you have anything to read? l just sit here.
You don't have a magazine or a book, nothing?
No, l just sit.
How come you didn't bring a book or a magazine? l don't need one, l like just sitting.
Who could sit on a plane for five hours like that? That's crazy. l can.
Excuse me.
Sir, could you please put your seat in the fully upright position?
Did he tell you to say that?
Did he tell you the seat wasn't upright? l don't know what you're talking about, but we're trying to take off. l saw him talking to you.
Sir, let me tell you what l need. l need you to be quiet and in this seat, with the seat fully up.
That's very good, you're learning quick.
Would you mind telling me what he said to you up there?
Then we can't talk any longer. l got stuff to do.
Hey, Schwimmer.
Did you tell the stewardess my seat wasn't in the upright position?
No.
Hmm, interesting.
That's my business.
Just give me a snippet.
No, the discussion l had is privileged.
Can you give me a hint?
What's the area?
What could you be talking to a stewardess about?
Did you allude to me?
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the ''Fasten Seatbelt'' sign. lf you're up and about the cabin, please return to your seats and make sure your seatbelts are securely fastened. Thank you.
Welcome to The Regency.
Welcome.
Okay, all right.
Ah.
You know what?
Don't have any small bills. l detect a little skepticism there. l'm all over this, all right?
You'll see, l'll be back.
Do l detect any doubt there?
Here, this is a better idea.
Split it with Tim.
You know Tim outside?
Thanks a lot.
This is your key, access to your room. lt's a card, this is the card slot.
Simply insert the card into the slot.
There's a beeping, wait a second.
Firmly apply pressure and in you go.
Dial nine to get out.
Just open these.
To turn on the water, you go like that with your wrist and the water comes out?
Yes, yes.
You walk over to it and you can look out.
All right, excellent. l think l got everything.
The floor is for standing. l think l got it.
Kind of complicated. l'll go over it again.
You're dubious. l'm gonna get you tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
That's nutsy, right?
Come on.
Sure, it's very nuts. lt's crazy.
The guy will wind up with more money than me if everybody gave him a 20.
Who wants to sit in the room?
Let's go down.
You've got two days left until the anniversary gift expires. l've got two days until l open on Broadway.
You know your lines. You're gonna be great, don't worry about it.
Can't let this run out, my friend.
All right, give me a half hour. l'll see you down there.
Yeah.
How do you two know each other?
Yeah, we have a truck and we shampoo dogs.
We have a staff that does it.
We sit in the front.
Horses, cats, any animal.
What do you really do?
Come on.
He is about to star on Broadway.
Why are you making that face? l have a tic. l'm going on stage with a tic.
You don't have a tic. l didn't see the tic before.
Come on.
You know, it could throw off the show.
Ask her what she does.
What do you do? l'm a fellatio teacher. lf l had made it up would l have said, ''Ask what she does''?
How much money did he give you to say that? l don't know how anybody could do that without a blindfold.
No, it is not grotesque, don't even say that. lt's beautiful.
All right.
A little Mexicali.
Do you like spicy food? l love spicy food.
You okay?
Just the way l like it.
Hmm.
What's your favorite part of getting a blowjob?
That's my water.
How's the food?
Where do you live?
Live in the city?
Using that napkin?
Yeah, l don't feel hungry anymore.
Where are you going?
You'll never regret this.
Thank you, Herr Liebkind.
That's all l'm talking about.
Hey, what's up?
What's going on?
How much longer do you think this is gonna go on? l can't say really.
You know, we open in two days.
You want to be refreshed, right?
Yes.
Mmm, dude, have you seen my watch? l lost my watch l think at rehearsal. lt's a black Tag, with three silver things, like, three dials on it.
Come on in, hey. lt's all right, go ahead.
Nobody.
Okay, hold on.
Seriously, you look ill.
How's it coming?
Freezing in here last night. l could not turn down that air conditioning. you've gotta get in there and fix it and it'll work again. l could study the rest of my life, every day, eight hours a day, l could never do that. For the rest of my life.
Good morning.
Beautiful beautiful.
There you go, sir, thank you. $53? lt's breakfast. l don't set the prices, sir.
Eggs, pancakes, breakfast, yeah.
Tip is included?
Do people generally give you more
All right?
Thank you very much.
Pardon me.
How are you,
Mr Ethel Merman?
Especially opening night.
How's it going?
Rehearsal.
Rehearsal, yeah. l call it play practice.
When l was doing ''Pippin,' we stayed after school for play practice.
But how is it? l don't see you doing it at all, but you'll be great.
Open houses, you just go, you visit, you know?
You just go in, you tour around pretend you're buying, but you don't.
Just go drive around to homes? lf you're not buying them what's the point? Just to look at the homes? l can't do it anyway. l gotta study my lines.
Was l supposed to tip that guy? but you gotta tip him.
He performed a service and you tip him for a service.
Of course you do.
Good morning, Mr David. ls this a good time to clean up?
Okay, come on in.
Hey, let me ask you a question. l know whose watch that is.
Schwimmer, hey, l hope you get this message. l found your watch.
You can thank me at the meeting.
All right, goodbye.
Hey.
Everything okay? lt's all straightened out?
Straightened out what? l gave the other doorman,
What?
How you doing?
How you doing? Take care.
You sure he didn't give you anything?
Yeah, l'm sure. ln other words, he's got the $10 now, and he chose not to give it to you. l'm saying l didn't get $10 from him.
Hmm.
Okay.
All right.
Fine. l'll tell you,
Sanjay over there was a little upset this morning. you didn't take care of him.
Take care of him?
He's a repairman.
Well, yeah, but he helped you out
He works for the hotel.
My air conditioning wasn't working. l didn't have a good night's sleep.
What am l supposed to do?
Can you have any kind of conversation with you people without it ending up with a financial exchange?
A little perturbed, yeah, a little.
That's your job, Sanji.
You know, it's just like, 'Hey, l appreciate this.'
Excuse me, hey, could l ask you a favor? l'm not really very good at this stuff. lt's no big deal,
But do it horizontally.
Okay, you know what? lt actually works a lot better like this cause l get all the background. l see the buildings, l see the signs.
Okay, but take it horizontally, and if l want it vertical l'll Photoshop it, and this way l have the option.
You are constantly undermining every decision l've made on this trip. since you got off the goddamn airplane.
That's the actor.
We just picked up our tickets.
Great, oh, l can't wait.
Because you will fail.
He'll be here.
He'll be here.
Susan Stroman, the best director.
Okay, you think they'll work. l got your message, by the way.
All during rehearsal he was going,
What the hell is going on here?
Are you kidding or you really found it?
No, l found it and l had it in my pocket.
Did you look,
Remember putting it in your pockets?
Maybe it's in the cab. lt could drop out of the pocket. l'm just trying to comprehend this.
You lost my watch that you had less than an hour ago in your hands, correct?
Well, you owe me a watch.
There's no change. lt's a little different. You had my watch and now you don't.
Who found the watch?
Why is David this upset now? l don't know why
David's this upset now.
No, 'cause he lost
Hey hey, all right.
All right. All right.
We must go on here.
We have a show to do.
Max and Leo have got to get along.
The whole point of the show is that Max and Leo love each other.
That's the success of this musical, is that journey, that you not only become successful producers, you become wonderful friends.
Now, we can't let what has happened here come into this show. lt looks like you're building a sandcastle on the table.
Let's start to read.
Have you noticed?
Have you noticed him doing stuff like this?
You know, people have quirks.
Okay.
Larry.
Oh. l don't know what l was thinking. l can't do this.
Nathan, l'm crazy.
Stop it. Just stop it. l said stop it.
Now stand up.
Take this and go out there.
You can do it.
Don't even look back.
Oy. an hour and a half. l thought l'd get there a little earlier.
You did tell the stewardess that my seat
You're gonna be great. l'm gonna destroy your entire show, don't you understand?
You're doing a great job.
They're gonna love you.
The audience is not gonna love me.
Yes they are. Mel never would have let you do the show.
Cause my mother used to say that to me growing up. 'Go bang your head against the wall,' and l took it literally. l did. l used to bang it against the wall.
That's why l got this condition in the first place, listening to my mother.
Thank you, by the way.
That was dangerous.
That was really dangerous.
You know, l didn't even think twice about it.
Honest to God.
The right thing to do.
Well, thanks.
That doesn't happen much. lf l didn't go into show business, l was going to become a fireman. l've been thinking about that 10th anniversary present of yours.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Close the door.
What is that?
You've got a picture of Bush in your dressing room?
Yeah.
You're a Republican?
Yes, Larry, l'm a Republican.
Ugh.
What the fuck were you thinking?
A picture of Bush, who gives a flying fuck? l'd fuck her with a Bush mask on.
You think these glasses are okay? l think l made a mistake. l look like l'm about 85 years old in this costume,
Who's this?
Hello.
Andy, they're at the ''will call'' window. of course l left them there.
Quiet down, all right. l'll be there in a minute.
Stupid cousin Andy, you know?
The ticket, they don't have it at the ''will call'' window.
Shit, do me a favor, help me with this, will you?
How did you get this on? l can't even figure it out. l can't, l've got to take care of this.
They don't have my tickets, l asked.
How would l know to ask your name?
You said they'd be under my name.
Honest to God.
Excuse me.
Hey hey hey, there's a line here. l don't care who you are, go to the back of the line.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. l'll see you after, okay?
We'll go for coffee.
Yeah, in the hotel, right?
Yeah, l found it in the hotel.
David Schwimmer's watch.
Finders keepers? No, not finders keepers, that's not right.
Okay, okay, fine.
What are you doing in the lobby 20 minutes before the show fighting with a Sikh? lt's too long a story, l gotta get out of here. l can't talk now,
Okay, okay, happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
How did it go?
How did the anniversary gift go?
Did you cash in?
Oh.
But l'll still have an hour after the show ends.
No no, you still have an hour.
Okay, you should get going.
Good luck. l gotta go. are you kidding? how, what happened?
One of the maintenance guys from the hotel had it on.
Thank you.
You too, man.
Did you tell her about the seat not being upright?
What?
Stunned.
You guys are terrific.
You look like Bialystock, and you look like Bloom. 'The reviews come out a lot faster when the critics
And your first when you come in and he scares you?
Yeah, ''Scared, can't talk.'
Break legs, break everything.
We have these specially made up for Max Bialystock.
The reviews come out a lot faster when the critics leave at intermission. 'By the end of 'Funny Boy,
Max Bialystock's hopeless new musical of 'Hamlet, everybody is dead.
They were the lucky ones.'
And this is the best review we got. lt's good to be the king.
Such reviews.
How dare they insult me in this manner?
How quickly they forget. l am Max Bialystock.
You've all heard of theater in the round?
You're looking at the man who invented theater in the square.
Nobody had a good seat. l spent my entire life in the theater. l was a prot?g? of the great
Boris Thomaschefsky.
Yes, he taught me everything l know. l'll never forget.
What does that mean? l don't know, l don't speak Yiddish.
Strangely enough, neither did he. ln my heart l knew what he was saying.
He was saying, 'When you're down and out and everybody thinks you're finished, that's the time to stand on your two feet and shout,
Who do you gotta fuck to get a break in this town?''
Hello?
Anybody here?
Mr Bialystock?
Who are you?
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Why don't you speak?
Scared, can't talk.
All right, calm down.
Relax, get ahold of yourself.
Take a deep breath.
Ahh.
Who are you? l'm Leopold Bloom. l'm an accountant. l'm from
Yes, it's quite possible. lf he were certain that the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.
Yes?
What was l saying?
That under the right
That's the question.
What?
Feel this cheek, Bloom.
Feel that cheek. lt's like a tush. ls that not a tush? l got a tushy cheek.
Does that bring any scheme to mind?
Yeah. lt's not my fault, he gave me the tickets.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is my cousin Andy. lt may come as no surprise to you to learn that he is the product of incest.
Of course, among friends and relatives,
Andy is known by his
The Primary Reason
Unfortunately, l know from experience the only way we're going to get him to calm down is to put a Swanson frozen dinner on his lap.
Wait, let's go back. l know he's quite partial to the Salisbury steak.
You know, there might be an upside to this whole experience, because if any of you are looking and l know they're
Andy is subletting his mouth.
There's a lot of room in there.
But the turban, it has all kinds of practical applications. lt's a tourniquet, it makes a lovely sash.
Say you want to have an impromptu game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey, you've got a blindfold.
All right, what was l saying?
What was l saying?
What was l saying?
Yes, you keep saying that, but you don't say how.
Well, it's simply a matter of creative accounting.
Did you see the look on their faces when Larry David forgot every line he had?
Thank God that this damn play is going to be over. from the anchor, from the albatross of ''The Producers.' every single minute, every hour of every day.
No more sleeping in dirty beds in Pittsburgh.
We're free, free at last.
How did you know that he could ruin the show? How?
The minute l laid eyes on him, l said, ''This guy is a disaster. he's a storm.
He's like a storm that will destroy everything in its path.' l mean, he's got this gift.
Everything he touches, he dooms.
He's a little cyclone, a little tornado
Any minute now the show will be dead.
Here, a toast.
To the death of ''The Producers.'
May it rest in peace. lnnkeeper, innkeeper.
Another round of drinks here.
As a matter of fact, another round of drinks for everybody in the place.
That's very kind of you.
Partners, Leo.
All the way.
And nothing or no one will ever come between us.
Nothing or no one,
Max.
Come in.
Bialystock and Bloom?
What?
Excuse me.
Swedish.
Costing today?
Come in, come in.
Aw, fuck. lt's intermission.
Quick, hide your faces.
Honey, don't panic. There are a lot of shows on this street.
They may not necessarily be talking about
Larry David and ''The Producers.'
Who would have guessed
Let's get back. lf he's as brilliant in the second act as in the first, this show's gonna run for another five years. l've got to think. l've got to think.
No way out.
No way out. this is a small portion of the audience.
Let's go back and see what the majority has to say.
Let's hear from the majority.
Let's hear from the majority.
Yes, we'll hear from the majority.
I'm drowning.
I'm gonna die.
I said, God, help me.
Why? I don't know.
I was like a baby drawn to the nipple.
You know?
Or an adult drawn to the nipple.
Either way, right?
It happened for a reason.
Amazing?
True story, every word.
To life. L'chaim.
Every day is a gift.
Are you going to temple for the High Holy Days?
Given what happened, don't you think I should?
Yeah, it's a great thing, but you've got to get your ticket six months in advance.
It's a tough ticket to go to High Holy Days.
Why do you need a ticket to go to temple? It's crazy.
I'm not saying
I justify it, but you need a ticket, and I've got my tickets.
You know what?
I call you tonight.
Look at this thing.
You ever see a handle like this on a cup? What's the point?
You can't get your index finger in there. What's the point?
I like watching you do that.
I went by Leo's
Delicatessen.
You know what's up on the board?
A brand new sandwich called the Larry David.
Swear to God.
Leo named a sandwich after me?
You're kidding.
You're on the board.
Larry, what the fuck?
I'm having fun.
Call me Mr Tibbs.
Don't answer that.
Actually, that might be Jeff calling about the temple tickets.
He'll call back.
Because I told him to try and find out. Hello?
You can always try for a scalper.
Really? They got scalper tickets?
I have no idea.
Sure, man. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
What?
What's the big deal?
What?
Why did you have to answer the phone?
Cause I told you
I was expecting a call.
I don't know.
Jesus.
Quiet for intercourse.
Shh. Don't disturb the intercourse.
It's the first time
Look at that.
Larry David sandwich.
I really kvell from this.
Ah, all right, all right.
I don't even like it.
You don't have a lot of respect for speech.
You could speak a little clearer.
It wouldn't hurt anybody.
You're laughing in my face.
I don't have respect for speech?
How are you, sir?
Leo.
First of all,
Larry David sandwich, huh?
Will you look how proud he is.
No problem. It is my pleasure to put the Larry David sandwich
You like it, yeah?
You like it?
Eh.
I'm not really a big fish guy to tell you the truth.
This is the best whitefish in the whole wide world.
No other place got this whitefish but me.
I'm sure it is, but I'm more of a pastrami, corned beef kind of guy.
Can I get a pastrami, corned beef thing?
You are
No tongue.
Hey, let me ask you this, okay?
What do you think about that?
Okay, I tell you what
I'm going to do for you.
What's the matter?
Take a drink of water.
It's okay, Pop.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I've got your glasses.
Well, your dad has had a mild stroke.
He's gonna be fine.
I've got him lightly sedated and he's resting.
He's doing very well and it's nothing for you to worry about.
My feeling is we may do a little corrective surgery.
I don't know exactly when, but we'll have him here for awhile.
Let me ask you a question.
Actually, they named a sandwich after me.
The Larry David.
But the bad news is that I can stand the sandwich, between you and me.
What is it?
I see you recoiled.
Was it a breath thing?
I guess it's possible.
You know, it could raise his blood pressure.
His life is not threatened.
He's fine and he's resting.
The sandwich gave him a stroke.
How do you like this?
The sandwich.
I'm a big fan of Seinfeld.
And I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna do your father's surgery for you.
I'm chief surgeon here.
Would like to get together and play?
I can't believe that that sandwich might have been responsible for this.
Whitefish.
Why did he have to give me whitefish?
What stinks in here?
You know what?
I think you smell from the onion.
You want a mint?
Take a mint.
No mint?
I got a whole handful of them.
What?
What?
What is it?
I'm a doctor?
What?
I'm a doctor?
Adopted?
Okay, okay.
Let's go.
I'm adopted.
I think I'm adopted.
I might be adopted.
I think I'm adopted.
I could be adopted.
I might be adopted.
Dennis, hey.
Where'd you come from?
Upstairs.
Upstairs?
Hey, do you mind if I stop this for a second?
I have an idea.
I've suspected this a long time.
I really did.
The only noticeable thing
I have in common with them, honest to God, is my penmanship.
I noticed there's a similarity.
Bad fingers.
Hurt my fingers.
All right.
I'm awful.
I don't know how
I was at his office.
Thought I'd bring him by.
Told him you were filming here.
Thanks, buddy.
I'm in there all the time.
I'm in there three times a week.
You know, and in as much as you don't go in there,
Switching sandwiches?
You don't go in there.
I'd like to eat my own sandwich.
It would be fun to go in with my dad and eat my own sandwich.
All right. What the hell.
What's the harm?
You know whitefish? and sable.
What is sable?
Sable. It's a fish.
It's like a whitefish.
It's a smoked fish.
Yeah, but they blend very well together.
They're like Siamese twins, whitefish and sable.
What else is in it?
Capers.
I'm not sure.
If you don't like them, you can brush them off.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Awful?
My sandwich is turkey, coleslaw, Russian dressing.
It's a classic. People come in, they order a Ted Danson.
Yeah, but you're not there.
You don't go in there.
It's not herring, okay?
It's whitefish and sable.
That's not herring.
Instead of ordering a Ted Danson, people order a Larry David.
What's the difference?
One tastes good and one sucks.
Why don't you taste the sandwich?
Tickets? Tickets?
Tickets?
Happy New Year.
Tickets?
You need tickets?
The cantor will be practically spitting all over you.
Really?
How much?
Give me $600 for the two.
I'll take the $300.
You have no idea what a deal this is.
Incredible deal you got here.
I'm giving you the deal of a lifetime.
I don't understand why you buy tickets.
Exactly.
By the way, thank you for carpooling with us.
I really never expected you'd get in my car again
Listen, this adoption thing,
I was thinking about it.
Any relative who would know, they're all dead.
There's one person.
Antoinette tracked her down.
And I've written her a letter.
This is terrific. That way you'll have definitive yes, no.
You might not be happy, but you'll know.
Let me ask you guys a question.
You pick up the phone during sex?
You're in the middle of an intimate moment with your loved one.
If every blue moon I have sex,
I'm not gonna pick up.
You're having an intimate moment and you pick up?
Got a bad hand.
I'll see you inside.
Well, you've got your Al Capone hat on.
This happens to be a very expensive hat, mister.
Be among those who cherish truth above ease.
Their essence remains for us in the life to come.
Hey hey.
I bribed him.
That's rich.
What are you talking about?
I eat anything off the menu.
What were you talking to him about?
None of your business.
The new year.
Leo, I didn't get a sandwich.
I want a sandwich.
Your sandwich stinks, by the way. It stinks.
You stink.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm gonna need to see your ticket.
Is there a problem?
What's the problem?
This the guy?
All right, great.
Little tattletale.
You little snitch.
He spilled the coffee, by the way, because I couldn't put my fingers through your dainty cup.
You're setting a bad example for my gentile wife.
It's her first time in temple.
How are we gonna get home?
We carpooled with you.
You'll get a ride.
There's plenty of people.
Friends, let us continue on page 133. divorced his wife and is seeing his secretary.
No, not yet.
But I think if she gets the letter, she's gonna get in touch with me.
We'll see.
Yeah yeah yeah.
He's got the yips.
The what?
The yips.
Okay, it's in golf.
You line up to putt and your hands shake.
He was shaking like this.
Well, maybe it's just a golf condition.
He gets nervous when he putts.
I can't take that chance.
He's operating on my father.
You need to call him and tell him not to do it.
I hate these calls.
Pick up the phone and call the doctor.
Maybe you could call him.
If it was my father
I would've already been on the phone.
Okay.
Could you leave the room?
It's like calling for a date.
Yeah, that's what you said.
No, I never said that.
I wouldn't say that to you, no.
It's not true, no.
Listen, that
Larry David sandwich,
I didn't finish it.
I remember seeing a half a sandwich still on that table.
You want the other half?
You know, I just ran into your doctor.
I'm meeting him there for lunch.
You sure
I'm not adopted?
I never said that.
Never.
Okay.
We'll see what
Mrs Seiderman has to say.
And I say that it happens every single time.
I swear to God.
I wouldn't lie to you, not to you guys.
Larry, what are you doing here?
You stole my sandwich?
Is that what you did?
You're blaming me?
I saw you talking to him outside the temple.
I always talk to people outside.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
It's the New Year.
I talk to deli owners.
I talk to pawnbrokers.
You had to get your sandwich.
I got information you might be interested in.
I can't wait.
What is it?
I'm adopted.
Bullshit?
No, it's not bullshit.
What do you mean you're adopted?
I'm adopted.
I know that, but I know who yours are.
Larry, you are adopted?
You are my brother.
We are in the brotherhood of the adopted.
Larry, come on over here.
You know what
I'm going to do?
I'm going to let you have any sandwich you want.
Okay okay, I wait.
I think I'm going to have to go with that Ted Danson.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Leo, this is Dr. Sewell.
I think I'll get that
Larry David to go.
Do not even think about it.
I'm expecting a phone call from Mrs Seiderman.
Do not pick up that phone.
Nobody's picking up.
I had an answer to his question.
If only he had picked up.
Mrs Seiderman?
Mrs Seiderman.
Mrs Seiderman.
I go, what is it, dad?
Maybe he said, you're a doctor. I don't know.
But why would he say I'm a doctor? I would know if I'm a doctor.
Why do you think he would wait until now to tell you?
Maybe he thought he was dying.
Yes.
First, how did you find me?
Best best private investigator in Los Angeles.
Look, Mr David, I have to be honest with you.
Basically what I'm saying is, I don't see a way that you would, uh, be helping my community.
You got, like, a community center for bingo?
Bingo's a distraction.
Don't underestimate bingo.
I've got extra sneakers that I don't wear anymore
I'd be more than happy to donate 'em.
Mr David, I don't think this is gonna work.
It would mean an awful lot to me. Please please, think about it.
If there's anything I can do to convince you,
What about a big brother kind of thing?
I'm not talking about for a long time.
Well, it says men on it. Yes.
It's a natural question to ask.
Okay. Thanks, Mr Jones.
That's my stall.
Well, then you wait.
I couldn't wait. It was an emergency. I had to go.
There's one stall for me, and you're in it.
If you were here, I would have given you first dibs.
A handicapped person?
It's disabled.
I think I would prefer handicapped.
God, you know how archaic that word is? A handicapped person.
That's demeaning, don't you know?
I mean, you know, I don't care either way, I'm just curious.
Hey, that's a handicapped spot.
What's with the walking?
Really? Why?
I know, yeah, but you know what? It's kind of cute.
Seeking attention, getting rejected.
Are you coming to my parents' 25th anniversary party?
I am.
It'll be fun, really. Think about it.
I'm not gonna think about it, but whatever.
Bye.
All right, is it my imagination?
Totally embraced me.
Completely.
The men's room key from the private investigator's office.
I forgot to bring it back.
It's a smart look.
I think I'm gonna get me one of those.
Hey, thanks for sending the invite back. 25 years of marriage.
And I have Larry David's place card right next to hers.
She's dating a guy. I think it's serious.
She's dating a guy?
Yeah, she's no longer gay.
What? You're kidding. That's fantastic.
Congratulations. Good for you.
Good going.
Yeah, I'll see you at the party.
Larry, we need to talk.
It's over?
What's over?
The marriage.
Why would our marriage be over?
You said, we need to talk.
Well, you know, you said, we need to talk.
Generally, when couples break up, that's how they introduce it, you know, we need to talk. why would you even think that?
And when women broke up with you, did you light up like that?
You know, it could have been a defense mechanism.
That's how I react to things.
Well, I wanted to know if we're going or not.
I wasn't going, and now I've changed my mind.
Rosie O'Donnell's gonna be there.
Our table.
And you know what else?
Are you loving that? Is that fantastic?
You're gonna love it.
Look who's here.
This is our new house.
What do you think?
It's just for a few months until the renovation's done.
You know.
A hotel? Hotels are good.
You know, there's a lot of activity in the hotel lobby.
I think that's a good thing.
Put a little concierge desk over there.
What the fuck, Larry?
Fair enough. Good answer. I don't know.
I totally accept it.
Come on, it's just Wanda. It's just Wanda.
We're all done in there.
Hey. Hey, little buddy. Come here.
What's wrong with your dog?
I don't know. See how friendly he is?
Good dog.
He probably smells my dog.
Hey, come on.
Get over here.
What did you do?
I don't know what's going on.
You have a racist dog.
Larry, you trained the dog to hate black people?
No, I didn't train it to hate black people.
Has it barked at any white people?
Exactly. Your dog is racist.
Sheriff's racist?
Sheriff?
That's a perfect name for a racist dog.
Sheriff the fucking dog that eats black people.
What the fuck, man? but I am not bringing my black ass back up into this fucking hotel until y'all get rid of that fucking klan dog.
Sir, could you repeat that? What's that?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, could you just keep it down a little bit? We can't hear the waiter. with my family over here. Know what I mean?
I'm not keeping it down.
Keep it down.
You're acting like you don't know?
What did I do?
All right, let me give you a clue, okay?
Starts with a J and it ends with an I.
Jedi?
It's Jodi, okay?
I wasn't really happy for him, I was pretending I was happy for him.
You know, the lesbian community used to revere you.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Don't even waste your time talking to this man.
This man is a racist.
He has a racist dog.
He has a dog that attacks black people.
How do you know that?
Because we talk, Larry.
Are you having fun or what?
What did you tell Jodi?
I told her you were just maybe a little overjoyous at the fact that she was dating a boy.
I'm happy if Jodi's happy.
By the way, where's Rosie O'Donnell?
She's not here yet.
Sure you invited her?
She'll be here.
Okay.
This is Jodi's new boyfriend. This is Larry David.
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.
Well, because we don't know what we're doing as much as the women know.
You know what's going on down there?
I'd be intimidated, I know that.
Yeah.
I always wondered, do you walk around in your bikini at home?
I think I want to go home. Let's go home.
Well, it's rude. You stay for dessert.
I need to use the bathroom.
This project demands I get back to my base.
Cheryl, you need to tell the whole table?
You've never done that with me at lunch?
He can use this bathroom.
You'll go in the middle of fifth avenue. It's different for jews.
You cannot leave an affair before the dessert is served.
What is this dessert thing? We don't have to leave after.
Everybody here seems to know, but the rules don't apply to you?
What am I supposed to do? Sit here for four hours and be uncomfortable?
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?
All right, great.
Hey.
I'm meeting Julie.
Out? What do you mean? Out for a walk or out with me?
Hello, Mr David.
I gotta tell you, Mr David, I was thinking about taking the case, but I got a distressing call today about your behavior last night at the banquet.
What are you talking about?
According to one of the brothers, you said, keep it down.
How do you even know about this?
We talk, Mr David.
We talk.
I'm returning it today, I promise.
Well, like I said, I'm gonna have to think about it.
Thank you.
How was everything?
Do you want coffee, dessert, on the house?
I'll have a cupcake.
No, I just cleaned them.
It's nice to have you back, Larry.
You, my friend, are back in the lesbian bosom.
Wow.
By the looks of things, better than ever.
What?
I'll be right back. How did he even know I was here?
What did you say to Dan?
I said, Dan, this is Larry David.
Then I left you.
And I said hi, I said hello, I said, hi, Dan.
Yeah, what else?
You know, a little small talk, hi, how are you doing?
Where are you from? and all that.
Why didn't you just say, hello Dan, I'm Larry.
I said hi, then I said that.
Yeah, problem. Now she's back with a woman.
They're all smiling at me. Of course, it makes perfect sense.
You left my party before dessert.
How can you do that?
It's not proper etiquette. before you can leave a party.
Yeah, no one cares what you subscribe to, okay?
We were trying to recreate what happened 25 years ago, and I said, Larry, would you like to make a toast?
You stay here.
Okay, boy?
You stay, Sheriff.
It's all right, though.
You know, what happened that day was
I stood up at the meeting, I told everybody, I know the guy.
I vouched for you. You're all right.
She's back on the team. Everything's good. Don't even think about it.
You know, we missed you at Funkhouser's party.
The what?
Marty Funkhouser's 25th anniversary party.
Yeah, I don't really know him. No.
Was it good? Did you go?
And don't worry about that other thing.
I just want you to know, gone, like it never happened.
Everyone loves you. All of us.
You are a muslim.
Go, pray, pray.
Are brothers and sisters a little overly sensitive to being told to keep it down?
Am I right?
Cause that's kind of what happened at the party.
Did I interrupt the praying?
It's like a yoga mat, huh?
I just want you to know that muslims are a very forgiving people.
They are?
Well, it's true.
There's a lot of meshugana muslims, though, running around, are there not?
Being that we are a forgiving people, I have decided to take on your case.
But I'm gonna have to charge you a higher rate than I charge most people.
Well, whatever you have to do.
Do muslims shake?
To tell you the truth, I'm very excited about this.
I mean, this could be a huge thing for me.
Bathroom key.
You know what?
I gotta go again.
All right.
Well, look at here.
Look what's doing here.
Aren't you supposed to be in here?
That's like from the eighties, who doesn't know that?
Well then you wait.
You wait.
All right, Sheriff.
Ok, good boy.
My bathroom key?
I love dogs, I have a couple on my own. you know
Won't happen again.
Good to see you.

Transcript by Raceman
How do those feel to you?
Well, they feel pretty good.
I kinda like these orthotics.
Yeah, they're really going to help.
Boy, they sure make a lot of noise.
They take a while to work in.
Ah, Jes?s.
How are you?
Yeah? You seem a little down.
Small favor, okay?
It's a Mezuzah.
Got that?
And I need you to put it over the door here.
This is like a Jewish thing.
You know, we put it over the door will know that we live here in case they wanna burn down the house.
Anyway, you just need a nail.
Get a nail, hammer and a nail,
Hello, hello?
How do you feel,
Mr David?
That's good.
That's good, Jes?s.
Either one, si.
It's okay.
Okay, okay.
It hurts on the bottom of my feet.
I have the exact same thing.
Do you want your life changed, Jesus?
See this?
It's called an orthotic.
Just put 'em in the bottom of your shoe, and that's it.
No no no,
Huh?
Honey, what could it hurt?
It make you feel better.
It takes a little time.
They're really loud.
Well, they're very good for my feet, I could tell you that.
Let me ask you
Why is it that before you have a meal, you do the whole cross thing, but not for a snack.
I don't think it applies to snacks.
I guess, otherwise you'd be crossing all day long.
Have you ever seen any crossing on a snack, ever?
I'm gonna be on the lookout for people who cross before snacking.
What's that?
This is a nail.
I bought this on the internet.
It's from The Passion of the Christ.
What, are you kidding?
No.
Have you seen it?
I didn't see it.
They have all kinds of things in the internet for The Passion of the Christ.
You're nuts about this
Jesus guy, aren't you?
I can see worshipping Jesus if he were a girl.
I'll worship a Jane. it's like a little kinda, you know, it's a little gay, isn't it?
I could have a relationship with a Jane.
That's all I have to say.
That's all I'm saying.
What are you doing?
I had the bra in my hand, and it's kind of like, you know, if you have a driver's license you check out the date of birth. That's all.
And what'd you think?
Stand to watch her clean room to room without a bra.
It's very distracting.
I know, but that's a big move.
You know, why don't you just tell her to put a bra on?
I would rather just get rid of her.
First of all, she makes the best chicken salad.
I would really miss that.
Well, Larry, then you're gonna have to tell her to wear a bra or fire her.
I'll talk to her.
I'll talk to her, no problem.
They make a lot of noise.
You gotta break them in.
Yeah, but his feet feel really good.
Cause you know, between you and me,
I need to talk about with you.
Okay.
Cheryl and I were having a conversation the other night.
Well, last night, actually.
Don't like 'em.
Not for me.
Hmm.
Because, you know I got
Distracting?
Yeah, a lot of flopping going on.
Don't like the support things, they're uncomfortable.
I haven't worn one in 15 years.
They're inviting and cozy and cottony.
What do you call that cotton?
Puma?
That's a sneaker.
Pima. Pima.
No, I don't like 'em.
All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you.
I'm gonna buy you a bra, how about that?
I'll buy you one, you'll try it, you'll put it on, you'll see what I'm talking about.
My treat.
I'll just try it on and let's see.
I'm gonna get you a bra.
Where are you?
I'm in the kitchen.
What's the story with that?
I haven't been able to find my can opener.
But everything
I look for, gone.
But I'm pretty sure.
Of course, my housekeeper,
I had to tell her to wear a bra.
You had to tell your housekeeper to wear a bra?
I have to buy her a bra.
I just don't know what size she is.
Look at that, huh?
Yeah, Tooth Fairy'll be coming tonight.
Wait a second, what is this?
What, Tooth Fairy.
What, are you kidding?
She's like 11 years old.
It's none of your
God damn business, Larry.
Her tooth falls out, we stick it under her pillow.
She still believes in the Tooth Fairy?
Yes, she still believes.
What's the matter with that?
Jesus Christ,
I'm shocked.
You don't understand children.
You don't know child psychology, and what they believe and don't believe.
I knew there was no Tooth Fairy even before my teeth fell out.
Really? Maybe that's what your problem is.
What are you looking at?
What?
No, nothing.
All right.
Thanks for your help.
Yeah, my pleasure.
Do me a favor? For the rest of the night, just leave us alone.
I think she's about the same size as Maria my housekeeper.
What, B cup?
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm giving you Susie's bra size, give me Cheryl's bra size.
You don't tell me Cheryl's,
I ain't telling you Susie's.
I'm not the one who has to go out and buy a bra.
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
I could be general manager
I know as much about basketball as these idiots.
I just need the opportunity.
That's all, just the opportunity.
A young, fresh kid out of college just needs the opportunity.
I do.
I know I could do it.
What are you doing?
What are you doing with that money?
I was checking to make sure the Tooth Fairy left it.
You're lying. You're a liar.
You're the Tooth Fairy.
There is no Tooth Fairy.
I'm gonna kill him.
It's you.
You're the Tooth Fairy.
Sammi caught me putting the money under her pillow.
Because you woke her up with those things in your shoes, and now
She knows that there's no
Tooth Fairy now.
I'm her mother.
Trust.
I know, but it had to happen eventually.
You know, you're a stupid fucking idiot. I cannot listen to this.
Jeff, do you hear this?
It had to happen eventually.
His orthotics, whatever the hell they are,
I told you it takes a while to break 'em in.
Let me just posit this, okay?
It might be a blessing in disguise.
Enough with the Tooth Fairy.
Not your business, Larry, you misanthropic moron.
Not for you to judge.
She's our kid, we decide when she knows about the Tooth Fairy.
Maybe you shouldn't have propagated this ridiculous myth.
Get the fuck out of my house.
Hey, what's going on?
What is it?
Larry, get rid of those orthotics.
Now I'll never get back to sleep.
May I help you?
For your sweetheart or your wife?
Girlfriend?
I'm not making it up.
It's really not for me.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.
There's a lot wrong with it.
You can't say that in this day and age.
I like to walk around with underwear on my head.
She hasn't worn one in 15 years. it's not a lacey French maid outfit.
Yes, this is our revolutionary Elasticene.
This is the best bra we make.
I like that.
I wonder if they make underwear out of this stuff.
They do.
We have matching panties.
No, for me, for men.
See, that's what I'm saying.
Feel free to try on anything here that you want.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not saying it's for me.
It's not for me.
Got a good selection for you here.
And the only issue, of course, is the size, which I have to say I didn't really know your size.
I got a feeling I think
I nailed it.
I really do.
Okay, try them all on.
All right, you're welcome.
Hey.
You're a sick fuck, you know that?
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Laundry room.
I looked at the tape.
Quite a show, Larry.
And what's all this mincing around?
What is this?
I was trying to imagine what it would be like to be the housekeeper and have those breasts you know, working and doing dishes.
And how did that feel?
Did it feel good?
This is how your housekeeper washes dishes, like this?
Why are you looking at her breasts?
I don't understand why you would walk into her laundry room and start rifling through her underwear.
That's what you're doing?
Staring at everyone's breasts?
Why are you buying her a bra.
You don't have to.
You're the one who made me get a bra for her in the first place.
I never said go buy her a bra.
What is wrong with you?
It's disgusting. Keep you goddamn hands off my brassiere, okay?
This isn't the first time it's happened.
The other day he's rifling through my things looking at my labels.
Pervert.
You sick fuck pervert.
I don't know what the hell it is, but it's sick and you better fix those goddamn shoes too.
Cause you know what he did?
He woke Sammi up the other night,
I was putting money under her pillow because her tooth fell out.
She caught me, now she knows there's no Tooth Fairy.
Yes, because there is no fucking Tooth Fairy.
Where have you been?
Bra shopping.
It's nice, it feels good.
He was woken up and now he's very tired today.
What's the Mezuzah doing over there?
My father's gonna freak out.
He's gonna be here any minute.
That's what Jes?s said?
Yeah, he was mad.
My father's pulling up.
Where's a hammer?
What about a nail?
Where's a nail?
I don't know where he keeps the nails.
What's going on there?
I'm putting up a Mezuzah.
Wait a minute.
Is that my nail?
What?
What is going on?
He took my nail.
He took my nail.
Took the nail right off my neck.
Why'd you have a nail around your neck?
That's Jesus' nail.
My father's coming right now.
Hey, boychick.
All right.
All right, kiddo.
Hi, Nat.
This is the best chicken salad I've ever had.
I don't know what the hell she does.
My God, she makes chicken salad, she wears brassieres, she does it all.
Yeah, she's very happy with the bras, by the way.
Really?
Yeah. Nailed, nailed the bra size.
Yeah, it's true.
I'm good at it.
Yeah, have your own little booth.
Step right up.
Of course, Jes?s freaked out about the whole thing. talking about the bra, asking her to buy a bra.
He told her to tell me to go fuck myself.
Did I replace the nail?
Happy man. Your dad's happy,
Unless, of course, any other emergencies arise that require a nail to remedy it.
You never know when you're gonna need a nail.
What?
Fuck.
Shit.
My tooth fell out.
What fuckin' idiot put bones in a sandwich?
I bit into a bone.
There's bones in the chicken salad.
Shit.
Fuck.
Quiet.
What's that noise?
What?
Jes?s.
I didn't see anybody.
Fuck.
Fell?
What is that language?
I have no idea.
What's this?
The nail.
I must have dropped it.
It saved me.
Very funny.
I don't know what you're talking about.Larry offends a Japanese art dealer by implying that his father was not a real Kamikaze pilot. Later, Larry accuses his own dad's retirement home of fixing their bingo game.
Ahh, chicken teriyaki boy.
Chicken teriyaki boy.
You remember Yoshi.
I like that, a little bow.
See that?
I am nuts about that bow.
Did they have anything at the gallery? look at this.
Cofey was here.
Hey, by the way, my dad and your dad are becoming very friendly in that nursing home.
It was just his 80th birthday party.
We took him to Japan.
Yes, he hadn't been back since the war.
What did he do in the war?
But what happened exactly?
Did he try and crash the plane into a ship?
Ahem, he grazed the ship.
Okay.
He grazed it.
Yeah, but at the last second, what happened?
Was he coming down, all of a sudden, he said,
Jesus, this kamikaze business might not be for me.
I'm uncertain.
You know what's good is the rainbow roll, because it gives you a little bit of everything. Hi.
I will have the chicken teriyaki.
Chicken teriyaki.
Chicken.
Chicken.
Chicken.
Isn't the damage done already
Hey, how's Lewis? You hear from Lewis?
I don't know what he's got. He's getting tests.
I'm in.
I'm going to present to you a nice little straight with a seven high. and given up for adoption.
Did the pizza place call by any chance?
Hey, what happened, isn't your brother playing?
But I can't get a hold of him. Maybe he's stuck in traffic.
I'll be there tomorrow. that I feel any sense of optimist about.
Isn't that insane?
You win more often than the other people?
Cedars sinai, okay. We'll be right there. Bye.
I gotta leave. I'll be back.
Get the coat, get the coat.
Let's go.
Suicide?
I just saw him last night.
We had dinner with him.
Did he seem weird?
Well, you know, we're here.
That's true, because, you know,
I had to really finagle to get out tonight.
I'm kinda happy to be anywhere.
And you know, we can't leave the house.
And we don't know the alarm code or anything.
And he tried, he didn't actually kill himself, he just tried.
That means he didn't, which means he's alive.
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
Yoshi's in the hospital. He tried to commit suicide.
How's he doing? He almost killed himself.
It's over. It's over. Out.
Out. Out. It's over. It's over.
It would have been rude to stop and pick it up on your way home, too.
We didn't know your alarm code.
I don't have an alarm.
Did Yoshi mention my name?
Thank god.
Yeah.
A suicide email?
What did he say?
It's very private, Larry.
Hey, we're married, you know.
It's part of the whole marriage thing.
I have to tell you, when you get married, you not only get the sex, but you get all the other stuff too.
All the information from the wife who doesn't hold any secrets.
If he wanted you to see it, he would have copied you.
Did he copy other people?
He cc'd a few people, yes.
Are you kidding?
I wanna know. What did he say?
Stop it.
I'll delete it. I'll just delete it.
Stop it, get off me.
You're not the checker. Lenore is the checker.
Cheat. we're going to continue with the game.
Just try to relax.
You gotta listen to her. She knows what she's doing.
Ruthie, do we have bingo? she has the bingo.
I won, everybody. I won.
I had bingo. You all know I had bingo.
And I won your dollar.
I'm gonna buy you a piece of cheesecake.
Thank you very much. I love cheesecake.
Actually I took the 110
Hello.
Hey, my wife tells me Yoshi's doing great.
Yeah, he's fine. He's home now.
Good news. Fantastic.
Have you ever played in that bingo game?
Have you ever noticed anything strange going on there?
I need to talk to you, Larry.
Don't, don't try to get involved.
Don't try to pretend you're concerned.
When we went to the hospital, I come back, you guys are all still playing poker, smoking cigars and eating pizza.
That's precisely why we were there, because we were concerned.
Yoshi tried to commit suicide, and you just completely put it out of your head.
We didn't put it out of our head.
We thought of it between hands.
Come on, how's that possible?
The whole kamikaze thing.
Excuse me for having a curious mind that asks questions of people.
I'm curious about how you can be a kamikaze pilot and still be alive.
There's a lot of kamikaze pilots that are still alive.
You say that, and I say to you, they are not kamikaze pilots.
He grazed the ship.
I think I might head home. This is fucking insane.
You taunted him, you called him chicken.
I didn't call him chicken,
I ordered chicken, you idiot. There's the difference.
You're a chicken.
You're a chicken.
I'd like a piece of chicken.
Well, he understood it as you calling him a chicken.
He must have taken it the wrong way.
And what about you coming and sweeping the chips off the table?
You cost me a lot of money.
I know for a fact you were down $300.
You actually owe me $300 if you wanna get technical about it.
I'll use my dad's phone.
I'm calling to apologize.
I'm eating pistachio nuts.
You're eating pistachio nuts while you're apologizing to me?
Yes, so?
You can't be sincere about apologizing and then snack on pistachio nuts.
What? I can eat and apologize.
There's no pistachio crunching in apologizing.
I respectfully disagree. I've snacked and apologized many times in the past and everyone's always accepted it quite graciously.
Hey, did you mention me in that suicide email?
I'm gonna write him a little prescription though.
A little blood thinner.
You know, I'm kinda glad I ran into you.
I won, I yelled bingo.
Now look, I can hear better than anybody in that room, okay?
I listen, I pay attention.
I'm a good bingo player.
A minute later Ruth wins.
Lenore came over, and she gives the dollar to her friend.
And don't tell me, after that game her friend Ruthie wasn't giving her 50?, all right?
Yes, I think the bingo game is fixed.
You know what you should do?
Take off your little smock here, take off your tie, sit in on a game, keep your ears open. Keep your ears open. Listen, to see who's winning at the bingo game.
You want me to go undercover to play bingo? Is that what you're saying?
Do you know anything about this game, doctor, that you're not telling me?
I know the bingo is for the residents, Larry.
And I know it takes place on wednesdays and fridays.
That's what I know, and I know they enjoy it.
Well, in a week or two, you're gonna come up to me and go,
Larry, you know what?
You were right about that bingo game.
That's all I ask. Just ask around.
Do a little check into it. That's all I ask.
I'm well.
Is this for you?
Blood thinner.
If you like, I could write it down for you.
But the doctor prefers this one.
Yes, but I prefer the other one.
But he likes this one.
But I like that one.
Doctor.
Pharmacist.
I'll go with the pharmacist.
I'm taking this to the doctor,
I'm getting a new prescription and I'll be back, Mr Pharmacist.
Thank you, sir.
Hey Larry, how are you?
Nothin.
Keep your eye on this Ruth.
She's bad news, I'm telling you.
Yes, Larry, we screen them to make sure they're old and sick and need care.
Well, she's on a lot of medication.
You think that's an excuse really?
I just came from the pharmacist.
He was quite passionate about it.
You know, he deals with this stuff all the time.
I'm a doctor, Larry.
Well, he's a pharmacist.
Yes, and I'm a doctor.
He's a pharmacist.
Doctor.
Pharmacist.
Doctor.
Pharmacist.
Fine, you go with the pharmacist.
Okay. Thank you.
Oh.
Fuck me. Fuck me.
Yeah. Fuck yeah.
Whoo. Yeah.
Dad.
Dad, I'm coming in.
Shh shh.
Come on.
We can't watch porno together.
Of course she wins a lot. This woman is a winner.
She wins a lot?
Yes, of course she wins a lot.
Hello there, Nattie.
No, die.
Die, die, die.
You're back.
The doctor was upset.
Doctors don't like to have their authority questioned.
I told him I had to go with the pharmacist, you know?
We see a lot of drugs.
I think this is a good choice.
Is that your name?
Cofey?
Yeah.
You could say that.
You know what, Cofey?
I think I'll go with the doctor.
You know, if you wanna taste my chicken teriyaki, you don't have to go through this charade of offering me the eel, whatever.
You know just ask me.
I don't want your chicken teriyaki, but thank you.
I know that you do. Here, take a piece.
The pharmacist had a nametag that said Cofey.
It's really getting annoying.
Well I was listening.
All right, I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Chicken teriyaki boy.
Chicken. Chicken.
Stop it.
Yoshi. Yoshi.
Cofey is here. {\a3}Cofey is here. {\a1}Cofey is here. {\a3}Cofey is here. {\a1}Cofey is here. {\a3}Cofey. {\a1}Cofey.

How do you fellas know each other?
Did I tell you? Huh?
Unbelievable.
What's he gonna do?

They're the ones who're supposed to be doing it 'cause they have the same blood and all that.
Jack in the box. I was just there the other night.
Pretty good.
He says he wants to donate all of his organs after he dies, but not a minute before.
Thank you, Louis Lewis.
Doesn't help me any.
Schmuck.
I'm gonna have to get on that kidney list like everybody else.
Shit.
I don't know what to do.
Just the test isn't gonna hurt you.
I gotta choose healthier friends.
This is no good.
I thought that that's what the whole deal was. we're losing the sickness and heath clause.
It'll be such a nice gesture and he'd really appreciate it.
All right, I'll take the test.
You're a very sweet friend.
It's very sweet.
Good night.
What are you doing?
How 'bout a nice snuggle here?
What's the advantage of that?
Because it's nice. You connect and it's warm and sweet.
How nice it is?
We'll snuggle another time.
Good night.
I'm using the ass as a lever to draw you in.
Good night.
Sure. What's this regarding?
It's regarding his kidney transplant.
What?
It's regarding his kidney transplant.
Mr Lewis is getting a kidney transplant?
What?
You didn't know about this?
He didn't tell you this?
He didn't tell you that there was a problem with his kidneys?
You asked me what it was regarding.
Could you tell him I called?
What did you do to my assistant?
She's freaked out, she's having a nervous breakdown, and I think she might even quit.
She asked me what the phone call was regarding.
Jeez, what am I going to do? She was a basket case.
Christ's sake.
What am I going to do?
I'll, uh,
I'll take the test.
I mean, you're my friend.
I'm making it up now. I wanna take the test.
What are you saying? Would you take the test?
Hello.
Yeah, this is Larry David.
Yeah, I was at a jack in the box.
That's really noble.
I was kind of wondering why you're not doing it.
You're his friend. Why shouldn't you do it?
A lot of people who have managers and friends need kidneys.
What does that have to do with anything?
I don't even know what that means.
You're close to him. You should be taking the test too.
Yeah, you're his oldest and closest friend. and I've known her for 20, who should give your wife the kidney?
I've known her longer.
By your logic, I'm the one who should be giving your wife a kidney.
You know, I'm loathe to mention this, okay, but you are an employee of mine.
Okay, you're really reaching now.
Yeah, I know. You don't want to give up your kidney.
Kidneys is past the line.
Mr David, what are you doing here?
You know I called up,
I was very polite and respectful, and she wants to know what it's regarding.
I'm a private eye, not a psychologist.
She comes into my office crying, you know, wondering what's going on.
Still, it's not you.
I mean, what if you were a psychiatrist and she said what is it regarding?
Hopefully we can we can avoid these conflicts, you know?
How's the adoption thing coming?
Piece of cake. They can't see you and there's nothing to worry about. Come with me.
All right, gentlemen, if you'll come in, please?
I changed my mind.
You're taking the test, I'll take the test.
Gentlemen, could I have you step up to the glass please?
That's very nice, very nice. He'll be very happy.
Second from the right. That's him.
You know who Peter is?
Are you gentlemen used to hanging out with known felons?
Peter the Crybaby,
Wendell the conspirator,
Joshua Lancel Stigmeyer.
All right.
Let him go. You're done here, gentlemen.
How do I let you talk me into this?
What was I thinking?
Who needs this?
I have good news, gentlemen.
Both of your blood types are compatible with Mr Lewis for his kidney transplant.
Good night, nurse.
Good night.
Bingo?
That's like asking me to play golf against Tiger Woods.
No, thank you. No. No.
Louis Lewis.
What's going on there?
He doesn't want to give up his kidney until he's dead.
Louis Lewis.
All right, you know what?
We'll just let Lewis decide. How about that?
Fine, let Lewis decide.
Yeah, most definitely, most definitely.
Sure. No campaigning.
Hey, Mr David.
I really had no idea that you didn't know about that.
He's on the phone with Jeff right now.
Well, what's it regarding?
I'm sure he was gonna tell you.
It's all right, it's okay.
I'm sure he was gonna tell you.
Yeah, no, don't worry.
There there, it's okay.
What the hell, man? Why did you touch my hair?
No, it's really weird.
Hey, what is this? Again? Again?
No you weren't. He was coming on to me.
Are you kidding me?
She thinks I'm coming on to her? Get out of here.
Get the hell out of here.
I don't know. She said she's leaving.
She said she was leaving. I thought she was leaving me.
She's just going out to have lunch with her friend.
Get out of here. I was touching her hair. She's crazy.
Did you get the news?
I'm a lucky man to have two of you guys come through for me. Thank you.
I am considerably older than him.
Nah, a kidney's a kidney's a kidney.
His are bigger too.
It's a big hefty kidney, could just handle a big load I think, you know?
You could start drinking again if you wanted to with that thing. hurts my feelings a little bit, buddy. that's all.
Please, I've been through everything.
I don't care how you figure it out. You know what? Flip a coin, man.
Eeny meeny miney moe.
What do I care?
And stay away from her, will you?
Whack job.
I got to start with me.
Eeny meeny miney moe, catch a tiger by the toe.
If he hollers, let him go. My mother says to pick this one
Start with me. Start with me.
Start with me.
Okay, I'm gonna flip this coin and this will be the kidney decider, all right?
Why don't we do eeny meeny?
I admire the both of you.
What you're doing is an unbelievable act of friendship.
Well, you haven't taken the test.
Are you ready to do eeny meeny?
No, I don't think I'm a match anyway. Let's just do eeny meeny.
Who wants to be eeny?
How come you want me to be eeny?
No, it's good. You should be eeny.
That's what you want, right?
Don't you want to be eeny?
Want me to be eeny?
Do you want me to be eeny?
Okay, here we go.
Eeny meeny miney moe, catch a tiger by the toe.
If he hollers, let him go.
My mother says to pick this one
Yeah yeah yeah.
No, you lost. You're out. You're it.
You stupid idiots. You don't even know how to play eeny meeny miney moe.
You're it. You're it.
What are we talking about anyway? Losing what?
They're giving a kidney to Richard Lewis.
Excuse me, you're not giving your fucking kidney.
What if one your kids needs a kidney one day?
You're gonna give a kidney to Richard Lewis?
No no no.
You are healthy and thin. You're giving the kidney.
I'm the winner.
No, that means you're out and the other people stay in.
That's if you're playing with more than two.
If you're playing with just two people,
I'm out, he's in.
That's how it works.
I know the rules of the game.
I think you're being a baby right now.
You know, it's totally unfair.
I'd have been better off just eating crap and smoking.
Maybe this is why you were saved when you were drowning that day.
That's why?
Well, I think you're doing the right thing.
Don't you feel good about doing this for Richard?
I don't. I feel awful.
Think about how he's feeling right now.
He feels good.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
Okay, you're welcome. I'll be here.
Okay, just forget it.
This is Kelvin Han Yee live from Studio City.

All right.
Happy birthday.
What did you wish for?
Yeah. Yeah, I know what you wished for.
What did you wish for?
It's a wish.
You wished that
Yeah, right.
Okay.
Let's go.
Open her up.
Look at this.
It's good to have a big friend, you can smack him around. Look at that.
Take a pop at him.
Go ahead, take a pop.
Take a pop.
Doesn't feel anything.
Let go.
He has one and I complimented him on it.
And he remembered what I said and he got me this.
This is the best birthday I ever had.
Best birthday a fellow could ever have.
I know, my gift is on hold.
Really?
When am I going to get it?
And you're going to love it.
Just trust me.
Try the jacket on.
This is tragic. Because this guy, he was sharp.
Well, at least it's not his hip.
Because once it's at the hip, then you're gone. They all say you're gone.
Hef invited me to a party at the Mansion.
Want to go to the Playboy Mansion?
Yeah, do I want to?
Yeah, but can I? I don't know.
There's no way.
You'll have fun.
I'd love to go.
I got to go to the bathroom.
What?
Yeah?
I've never heard anything like this.
Nat never said anything to me, to my mom,
Nothing.
This is wild.
You're nuts.
You're out of your mind.
Just leave it alone.
Can I help you?
I'm a friend of his cousin.
Yes. Right, yeah.
Yes, that's too bad.
It's too bad.
How's he doing?
Well, unfortunately he's not doing too well.
He's in an irreversible coma.
As you can see we got him set up
It's hard to say. It could be days, weeks, months.
There's been cases where patients have been in comas for years.
It's hard to say.
If you had to pick one.
I don't know if I could pick one.
Take a shot.
No.
What happens to the moustache in a coma?
It continues to grow. There's a lady who comes in a couple times.
Really?
The hospital has a barber?
Yeah.
She's a nice lady.
She clips his moustache, she does his hair.
Yeah, I guess you could look at it that way.
He's got all these organs he could be donating. You know what I mean?
Yeah. I suppose.
What do you think you're doing?
What?
You pull that plug and I'll tell.
No, it fell. It fell on the floor.
I'm picking it up.
Well, you just looked like you were about to pull the plug.
About to pull the plug?
Are you crazy?
Listen, that's a very serious thing you're saying.
You're practically calling me a murderer.
Okay. I'm willing to overlook this whole thing.
Are you? Boy, that's very nice of you, thank you.
Foundation turned down.
What was this wish that they wouldn't grant?
I want to see a naked woman.
Well, you know, I would love to help you out. What's your name?
Wilson.
I'd like to help you out,
My wife, that's the only one I know.
Fine.
That's your job.
I sneak out all the time.
Open it up.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's from Nat.
Look at that.
He sent me his smoking jacket.
But it's beautiful.
You know what this is about?
This is probably a birthday gift for me.
I'll tell you why.
He kind of got confused and he must have written your name on it.
You think that he did not send this to me?
Andy David. Look up at the top, in the return is Nat.
You can't accept the fact that he sent me a gift.
You can't accept the fact that your father sent me a lovely gift.
It's my birthday.
I have a question for you.
Have you seen that US magazine?
I threw that out.
What?
Why did you throw away my magazine?
Because he took it in the bathroom and contaminated it.
My father sent that jacket for me.
That's a mistake.
My father would not just send you his jacket.
He gave it to me because he likes me.
It's a mistake.
You're taking advantage of an old man.
This is my jacket.
It's mine.
You know he promised that jacket to me.
It's unfair. He didn't give me a birthday present.
He's just confused.
It's a big bowl of wrong.
Aw, come on man.
You're already in the doghouse, you can't get in any more trouble, you might as well get your money's worth.
It's a double transgression theory.
Double transgression theory.
And I could ask that kid
They'll take less.
Trust me. Trust me, they'll take less.
Call me back when you hear from them.
That'll be fine.
All right.
I'll talk to you later.
What?
What is this? Huh?
Take this off.
This doesn't belong to you.
You know it and I know it.
My father promised me this smoking jacket when I was 14 years old.
When I get back,
I want you out of that jacket.
You're going to the Playboy Mansion?
I don't want you walking around in this jacket anymore.
I want to go.
I wish I could help you.
I really do. I wish I could.
What's one guy, what's two guys?
You really want to go?
Give me the jacket.
You got it.
I'm going to go up and change.
Wait a second. I'm taking it to the drycleaner.
Speak into the rock.
What's your business, please?
Jeff Greene and three guests.
Proceed up the driveway please.
Look at this thing, huh?
Mercedes Benz,
What did you do?
What is with you?
I got to use the bathroom.
What's that animal walking around outside with the long neck?
What do you call that?
I'm not good at identifying birds and animals.
You know, like sneakers,
I can identify.
Converse, Adidas,
I know all that stuff.
I know sneakers, birds I don't know from.
Hmmm, I doubt it.
I have them imported from Italy.
I don't know.
I got it right out in the car.
I'll go get the smoking jacket.
Stay right here.
I think it's the exact same one.
I'm not kidding.
Unbelievable.
Hey.
What?
What's the matter with you?
You ruined my wish.
It could have been a coincidence.
They ran away from you, Larry.
It wasn't my fault.
Because I want to show it to Hefner.
What do you mean you want to show it?
Come on, hand me the jacket.
Hey.
I hope it's okay.
What do you think?
Huh?
Well, it's not a Roselli
There you go.
It even fits.
Wait till my father hears that Hugh Hefner was trying on his smoking jacket.
He's going to freak out.
Wow. Pretty good.
Pretty, pretty good.
Let me look at it in the mirror.
Not bad.
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
In Los Angeles.
Yeah.
You don't got much pockets in there, huh?
I couldn't live without pockets.
They're monkeys, they'll attack you.
They'll claw you to death.
There are people, though, let's face it, who do have a foot odor problem.
Are you saying
I have dirty feet?
Holly.
Maybe.
I don't think you want to go bowling with me.
Let's pretend to be ventriloquists, okay?
Remarkable.
They do impressive work in Korea.
You're wanted at the Grotto now, baby.
The Playboy Mansion?
That's where you were?
You didn't think that I would mind that you're running around with nude women?
There's no nude women.
They covered all up when they saw me.
You have no idea how hard I've been working on your birthday present.
And I finally got it back.
I have arranged for you to have lunch and play a round of golf with Gary Player.
Wait, wait.
But what can I say?
You know, it's like the dog who pees on the rug.
It's the double transgression theory.
How did you even know that I like Gary Player, by the way?
I remember you said when you were a kid you loved Gary Player
And he was your favorite.
Okay, watch the step.
You got a step and you got a little carpet here. Hey ya guys.
Hey, you know what I did last night?
You betcha.
Bobbi Sue.
Yeah, that's worth the trip from New York, huh?
How's it going, Pops?
How's the nursing home?
They steal from me.
You know my beautiful jacket, my smoking jacket?
Yeah, sure.
Your smoking jacket.
You actually probably meant to send it to me for my birthday.
No, you sent it to me because my name was on the package.
You always said you wanted me to have that jacket.
You gave it to me. that beautiful jacket to either of you?
I love that jacket.
All right, hold on.
What?
What's that?
What the heck is this?
My jacket is a Roselli jacket.
Take a look at this thing.
Take a look at the seams here.
It's a shmata, man. of my jacket.
It's a cheap, cheap imitation.
This is not a Roselli?
This is not a Roselli.
How did you get it?
Holy shit.
All right.
I'll get your jacket back.
Hugh Hefner has your jacket?
That one's actually my father's.
I apologize.
I don't think so.
This is a Roselli.
No, no no.
This is the Roselli.
That's my father's.
I can tell the difference.
Well, here. Maybe you should take another look at it.
I really haven't got time for this.
They're waiting for me upstairs.
Has he gotten any worse?
No, it's about the same.
No worse, no better.
That's very nice of you though.
Well, it is my friend's cousin.
Yes.
How do you know if he's dead?
Well, it's pretty simple.
Because he's an organ donor, and his organs need to be free.
Yes, I understand that.
If he sits here like a lox for a couple of weeks, the organs aren't going to be worth it.
Well, I don't think that will be a problem.
I'll see you later.
Yes, look who's here.
Hmm. How's it going with the wish?
I took you to the Playboy Mansion.
Okay. All right, get dressed.
You're getting to be a real pain in the ass, you know that?
My wife's in New York.
She gets very aggravated if she can't get in touch with me 24 hours a day.
I have to have constant contact all the time.
Whoa. Is this place your house?
Nah, we're just renting.
Yes, I have.
My wish is for Hugh Hefner's smoking jacket.
The red one with the black trim.
I've been such a fan of Seinfeld and to have lunch with you, and 18 holes of golf, what a way to have a day.
I can't believe my wife got in touch with you to do this.
This jacket? My friend gave it to me for a birthday present.
It's uncanny, Larry.
That's exactly like the jacket they award you when you win the Masters.
Now there's a 1961 Masters jacket.
Put it on.
Wow.
I cannot get over how similar this jacket is to that.
You mind if I just go and have a look at this in the mirror?
What? This is the one you beat
Palmer in '61, right?
Come on.
Look at that.
Hey, it fits you.
Yeah.
You'll have to excuse me a minute.
Morning.
Okay.
Hey, I'll do it.
Don't worry about it. Relax.
You never see people drinking grape juice.
Larry. Larry.
Did you know that a sex offender moved into the neighborhood?
Yeah, he's a bald guy, too.
What's very bad for the community is that he's a sex offender.
I know, as long as he's gonna be a sex offender
I wish he had a full head of hair.
Yeah, yeah.
Hmm. I haven't gotten my paper in six days.
A guy in a suit is taking my paper?
That's why she thought it might your friend of yours.
Jesus.
That's crazy.
A suit's a good cover if a guy's gonna steal a paper.
If you saw him again, would know him?
Yeah yeah, I'm pretty sure I'd know him.
A guy in a suit?
Huh?
I don't get it.
I don't get it at all.
What's a motivation there?
Guy in a suit's gotta be able to afford a paper.
Does she know what she's doing?
These machines are really finicky.
Yeah, let me give you a hand with that.
No no no no.
No, let me get this.
I know how to do it. I've got the touch.
I just know how to do it.
I know this machine.
Go ahead.
You want one?
Yeah, but I'll close it again and pay for it, because, you know. you're Larry David, right?
I never, ever do this.
But, you know, I'm sort of new to the neighborhood.
And I'm a huge
Seinfeld fan.
No, I'm, probably the biggest
Seinfeld fan ever.
You know what?
I love that show.
Yeah, it's great.
It's great.
How did you guys come up with the low talker?
Well, I mean it was pretty easy to come up with.
I was out to dinner with one.
Well, that's very nice of you. Thank you.
I'm Rick Leftowitz.
Where did you learn how to do this?
Well, Susie's been coaching me through it all.
Do you even know what this thing is called?
Haroset.
I wish my mother were alive to hear you say that word out loud.
Thank you.
I mean, I'm trying.
It seems like a lot of trouble you people go through for this.
You know what I mean?
Okay, I feel like I've been cutting apples for, like, two hours.
Okay, hey, you know what?
Marla and Mark got back together.
Good for them.
Good for them.
I thought you'd be happy to hear that.
That's nice. That's nice.
When did this happen?
About a week ago, and he moved back in with her.
Jeff asked me if he could bring
I know.
I talked to Susie.
Jeez, you know what
I just realized?
I never followed through on my Christmas present to Mark.
Remember I got him a subscription to the Times?
And then he and Marla broke up.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Because he broke up with his girlfriend?
Yeah.
I don't see the point to it.
I'll bet you Mark is the guy who's taking the paper.
No, think about it, seriously.
Think about it.
I can't believe it.
Mark is stealing the paper.
Holy shit.
Don't you see?
How long have we not been getting it, six days?
He moved back in with her a week ago.
You just said that, right?
Larry, he's a doctor.
I think he could afford the paper if he wants to get a paper.
It's not ridiculous.
It makes perfect sense.
What?
We should invite
Mac and Ethel.
We should invite them for Seder, don't you think?
You want to invite
Ethel and Mac?
You don't understand because you're not Jewish, okay?
But it's a Jewish thing.
Well, if Jews don't have any place to go for Seder, you're supposed to invite them.
Come on. Come on.
Invite 'em.
Hey, Larry.
Hey, let me give you a hand here.
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
Who the hell knows?
You play golf?
Yeah, and I eat and I breathe.
In that order.
Wow, wow.
Anyway, I replaced the four iron with a nine wood.
I can't hit it anymore.
Well, you know what?
People have tried before.
It can't be done.
Can't be done, Rick.
I've been golfing for a long time.
I'm fairly good.
Yeah, in my backyard,
I have this setup that you won't believe. I've got a net, a tee.
Get the hell out of here.
And you shoot yourself swinging and then
Yeah, why not?
Great.
All right, it's gonna be fun.
I love golf.
Did you see the whole thing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come here. Come here. Look at this.
Watch it in slow motion, okay?
Look at that.
See, you're bringing your hips through.
Look, look, I wanna freeze it right here. Wait, right there.
I can't believe it.
A plus. My best student of the day.
Good work. Okay.
Listen, anytime, anytime.
I'm completely spent.
That was great.
That was just great.
Nothing, nothing.
Totally free.
You want to come to my house?
No, really? Oh.
I got nothing else to do.
Yeah, I'll bring latkes.
I'll see you then.
Where were you?
He's kind of new in town.
And we got to talking.
Golf nut, okay?
Took me to his backyard.
Today, changed, irrevocably.
And you just started talking to a stranger?
Yeah, kind of, well, you know, he knew me from Seinfeld.
I hope you don't mind.
Well, that's cute.
I'm glad you made a new friend.
What?
You know, we saw that picture on the flyer of that sex offender guy.
That's him.
He's cool.
You invited a sex offender over for Seder?
Are you out of your mind?
You do not invite a sex offender over for dinner without talking to me first.
We're not having a sex offender over for dinner, no.
Cheryl, he's a Jew.
He's a Jew.
This is a fact.
Have you heard of the theory, the 77?
No.
Okay, every 77 years there's a great president.
And then another 77 years, you got W.
And we're turning the whole damn world around.
Jake, did you remember to call your mother?
What?
Did you remember to call your mother?
I told my mother I would call her after the Seder.
You know, things are booming right now, you know?
Nice to see you and Marla back together.
She's great.
She's great.
Yeah, what happened?
You couldn't cut it in your single life there?
That's funny.
Part of the perk of being a doctor.
It's not hard to get dates.
Get to see a lot of women naked?
You ever get aroused?
The answer of course is no.
I'm a professional.
People come to me for help.
I help them.
I understand. Tell me if you think this is an appropriate question.
And I mean no disrespect.
Have you been stealing my newspaper?
I have not been stealing your newspaper, Larry. That's appalling.
I'm quite sure
I haven't been taking it.
Are you positive,
Mark?
Okay.
What?
Look at this.
Hi.
And this is my wife Cheryl.
It's lovely to meet you.
You have a wonderful home.
Hey, this guy completely changed my life.
I'm telling you.
I can't believe the way
I hit the ball now on account of him.
Yeah, just wait till I'm done with him.
Different man altogether.
I can't wait.
Come on over here.
It is an honor to meet you, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Sure, yeah.
Excuse me for one second.
What the hell are you trying to pull, Larry?
He's smart.
He's funny.
He should not be in our presence on a holy day.
Any day.
What the hell are you doing?
Thank you.
Everybody parked in front of my house. Everybody here,
Ethel, hi, how are you?
My pleasure.
Ethel, what I want you to do is
I want you to take a look around this room here, okay, and just see if there's anybody who you recognize.
Take a look around.
Okay, gently.
Gently, guys.
Let's put her here on the bed.
Okay, let me just check her.
I think I hurt my back lifting her up.
Her pulse is okay.
She's breathing fine.
A couple of hours.
A couple of hours?
What, are you kidding?
Everybody have a nice big swig of wine.
Hey, guess what.
Okay, get ready, kids.
You know what's in here?
Matzah.
And I'm gonna hide this, and you've got to go find it.
And whoever finds the Matzah is gonna get a dollar.
Okay, a dollar.
All right, now go into the kitchen.
Go in the kitchen.
Close your eyes.
Don't look.
Cover your ears.
Okay, I'm gonna hide it now.
Don't look.
Okay, kids, you can come look for the Matzah now.
No luck at all.
For those of you who don't know,
I mean, a really good look.
If she ever sees him again, she'll recognize him.
She never forgets a face.
Well, hopefully, she'll wake up soon and come down and join us for the rest of the Seder.
That would be wonderful, wonderful.
Hey, there's no Matzah here.
Let's go, beat it.
Come on, pfft, beat it.
She's coming around.
That's nice.
That's nice.
I've been paged by the hospital.
Aren't you a cosmetic surgeon?
Yes, we have emergencies in that field as well.
You know, it's too bad.
She'll be upset that she didn't get to meet you.
I'll meet her another time, I'm sure.
Thank you.
In a hurry, doctor?
As I explained, I've been paged by my hospital.
Yes, I know.
Emergency boob job, no doubt.
I've been paged for a medical emergency
You're a doctor.
Yes yes, of course, you're a doctor.
You took that paper.
I know you did.
I'm a doctor, you idiot.
Good yontif.
Can I talk to you for a second?
This is really hard.
You're the perfect person.
What you need to see is a doctor or a psychiatrist,
I have to tell you.
Yeah, because he saw me hiding it.
We made eye contact.
He saw it.
Yeah, okay.
That's right. Let me ask you a question, Stevie.
I notice that you went to the bookcase once.
What made you go back there a second time?
Hey, look look, he found the Matzah, pay up.
I'm just trying to find out why he went back to the bookcase.
There's no need for the third degree.
Just pay him the dollar.
He found the Matzah, pay up. That's that.
Cause you told him where it was hidden.
That is a lie.
You don't know anything.
How would you know?
My friend told me, that's how I know.
Sammy, Sammy, get up.
Come on, come on.
What's the matter, honey?
She can't breathe.
She can't breathe.
I do.
You look fantastic.
Look at you. you're a blessed man.
Well, you know,
I took care of myself.
Never slept with a lot strange women.
I need a kidney, man.
Come on, you took the test.
You're a match.
Are you gonna give me the kidney or not?
Coma in the hospital.
How long can he go on?
Comas are unpredictable for Christ's sake.
Who the hell fucking knows?
Family.
Fuck family.
Look at the Mick.
Jesus Christ.
That's the 500th home run
It's yours.
And you get the money too.
I'm giving you the bread and the ball.
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's Mantle.
Yeah.
And if my cousin stays in that coma,
I'm depending on you.
It was nice of him to give you his ball like that.
We have a mutual acquaintance.
I know Jeff.
We actually dated a little bit.
Well, until things got, you know, intimate, it was fun.
He's kind of a slam, bam, thank you, maam kind of guy, right?
No thanking the maam.
He was like that.
I mean, it was dark, but honest to God it was like that.
Comas are very unpredictable.
Could wake up in five seconds, five minutes, five years. You don't know.
You just don't know.
They're unpredictable.
Because maybe she's afraid that you'll find out she has a big vagina.
Why would would she even do that?
How dare she?
I'll tell you what.
I bet you there's a ton of guys out there who've been labeled with small penis. why should there be as many big vaginas as there are small penises, right?
We're a hell of lot more discrete than they are, right?
They love this thing.
Well, you know what?
This is me from now on.
Yeah.
I'm on to you,
Mr David. the questions about organs, come on.
I'm not crazy. I'm chief of staff here.
I know what's going on.
What's going on?
Good job, Doctor.
I think you got me.
No, it's a big schlep.
Hey, Jeff.
George Lopez.
Good. Feel great, better than I have ever in my life.
I had a kidney transplant.
My wife gave it to me.
Changed my whole life, man.
I mean, without it,
I don't even know if I'd be alive, to tell you the truth.
You know, uh,
Richard Lewis needs one.
Cause he's on the bottom of the list.
Well, if you're the bottom of the list, you're fucked.
Buddy up to him.
Kiss his ass. Who knows?
Probably move
Richard up the list.
Ben Heineman.
Hey, Mr Jones.
Ben Heineman.
Well, Heineman could be spelled a couple different ways.
Come on, that's out.
I nixed that.
Look, you don't have to ski.
You can sit inside and enjoy the snow.
I'm not going up to that lodge.
Come on, man.
What is this?
Okay, Big Yankee fan.
He's an orthodox Jew.
All right, what else you got?
Drives a gold Cadillac.
I need to get close to him quickly.
You know, you pushed him off a building. like put my friend on the top of the kidney list.
And at no point, he says to you,
Hey, what about the fat guy that just threw me off the roof?
That would never come up.
No. I said it's bad version.
You know, bad version.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
See it?
Yeah, that's it.
Ready?
Yeah, as ready as I'm gonna be.
Whenever you want, go ahead.
You try it again.
I don't want whiplash.
No.
Here, come on.
Are you all right?
Yes.
All right, good. Let's get out of here.
Come on.
What a great great pleasure to meet you.
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah.
What a mitzvah it was for you to leave that note on my car.
Well, how could I do anything less that that?
I lost control of my car.
Morty, menus, please.
Hello?
It's impossible.
I'll take a rain check, however.
Ho ho ho ho, okay.
I'd love to go to the game, but not on the Sabbath.
I'm a huge Yankee fan.
I even cheat by watching it on television. I shouldn't do that.
There are two things in my life that I love.
I love to ski.
My yarmulke almost fell off,
Isn't that a wonderful coincidence?
It came out.
In fact, he had a completely different take on it than you.
Huge. Huge.
Are you kidding?
I don't have a big vagina. you got the huge vagina.
It's not necessary.
Methinks the lady doth protest too much.
Hm.
I can get you to the top of the list.
I'm not kidding.
I got him eating out of my hand.
He's going skiing with me.
Holy shit. That would be unbelievable.
You know what would really cinch it?
Let me give him the Mickey Mantle ball.
You're out of your fucking mind?
You don't want it?
Give that guy the Mickey Mantle ball, it's done, it's over.
All right, give it to him.
Give it to him.
What? Look, maybe it rolled off.
Look behind the picture.
Goddamn it.
Who's been here? Lisa, the nurse, a couple of close friends and you.
There was a Mickey Mantle ball, his 500th home run right over over there, and it's missing.
Could a ball worth an excess of $20,000 just disappear into thin air?
Wanna tell me what you're driving at?
I'll tell you what I'm driving at.
I submit you took that baseball, stashed it in your unusually large vagina, and walked right on out of here.
I'm surprised you're even letting me.
The bread and the croutons.
I've also taken the liberty, with your permission, of inviting an orthodox
Jew and his daughter.
Where? To stay in the chalet with us?
Richard Lewis moved up on the list.
Let's be realistic. You're trying to get
Lewis moved up on the list or you're trying to save your own kidney? to spend a weekend with these people.
Forget the whole thing.
I don't want my kidney.
I'll walk around with a dialysis machine. That will be fine.
We don't have a choice.
You invited them.
We don't have a choice, but it's a mitzvah.
You spend time with them.
I'm not going to hang out with them all day.
Unfortunately, that's not
She's a wonderful cook, isn't she?
Yes, a singles and he was there trying to pick up every girl imaginable.
I was in the band, okay?
The girls were pretty interested, you know?
It's Making It
Yes, it was
The Hipsters.
And then,
I left The Hipsters,
And The Hipsters went out on their own.
But I wasn't attracted to him from the band.
Of course.
Excuse me?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
I don't give a shit.
Do you think I care about your back?
You know how much I've done for you this weekend?
Get the fuck out of bed.
What? Bacon?
What, are you crazy?
You're making bacon?
People don't eat bacon.
What, are you nuts?
It's not kosher.
How did you do last night?
I did fine.
How did you do?
I missed you, honey.
I missed you too. we ate the pot roast on last night?
They are the same plates, but they've been washed.
I shouldn't be having dairy on these kind of plates.
You know, as you know, the dairy and the meat are on two separate plates.
That's a necessary rule of being kosher.
Where are the milchig plates?
Where are they?
You were told about the milchig plates, were you not?
Okay.
That's fine, I have to bury the plate and we'll be done with it.
Why would you bury a plate?
Why would you bury a plate?
Tell her.
You have to bury the plate to purify it.
It has to go underground. and call it a day, no.
That's not how it works.
Do you wanna bury it as the man of the house?
Nah, you bury.
You bury, you bury.
It's a little early for burying.
I don't like to bury before coffee.
I lit a match.
You are a guest in this house.
Larry, come on.
Larry.
Get off my skis.
No no, we're losing time.
No no, it's fine. I'm tired.
We'll do one more.
He'll keep you company.
Larry, incidentally, the thing we were discussing earlier.
I'm thinking about it, and I think
I can actually help your friend.
I think I can move him up on the list.
I'm fainting.
I'm gonna faint.
It's a pleasure to do it for you.
God bless you.
Now you two kids go. Go ski.
Rachel, come.
Come.
What do people have against whistlers?
I think it's 'cause they don't like to see people happy.
And who can blame them?
It's like a happy couple.
Is there anything more disgusting than that?
You know what I find very interesting?
I can't draw to save my life, but yet, I'm a very good doodler.
Don't you think that's ironic?
It happens all the time.
Should only be a few minutes.
It's been 15 minutes already.
What's going on?
Shkiyas Hachama.
That's what's going on.
Sundown.
I can't be here alone with you after sundown. and I'm a single woman.
Well, you got another half hour.
They'll fix it.
Freezing.
I'm hungry too.
What the heck is this?
Hey.
Edible underwear.
They're not bad.
Move that away from me.
Just tell me how much time we have left.
I can't be here with you after sundown.
You're gonna have to jump.
Are you gonna jump?
What, are you fucking nuts?
What?
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Are you insane? what I told you earlier about the kidney?
You're shitting me.
I, I, I don't know.
Did Larry David leave his cell phone in the house?
I'm gonna call my cell phone.
If you hear it ringing,
Larry. God, Larry, come on, what are you doing? We're late for the barbecue.
No, it gets chilly at night at the beach, are you kidding?
There'll be a fire.
Why are you wearing corduroys?
I'll leave it in the car.
What's the big deal?
I think you're just a little overdressed.
All you need are
You know the story of the three little pigs, the one who built his house with bricks?
I build my house with bricks.
I will think of you as the third pig.
When we get there, will you please apologize to Mark for the way you treated him at the seder?
Accusing him of stealing your newspapers?
I already apologized to him, I told you that.
I don't know how you can eat this thing, really.
Why don't you just burn everything you eat to a cinder?
Why stop at the marshmallow?
It's the situation.
We're sitting around a campfire.
I don't want to spoil your fun.
You're having a good time.
I'm just saying it's idiotic what you're doing.
Try this one.
Try one.
No, it doesn't taste good.
I don't want it.
Thank you for your opinion, Larry.
That's a perfect fire I built.
Whose idea was it to have s'mores tonight?
He can't handle the truth.
Another perfect one.
Who's ready?
My jacket's not in the car.
You said that you brought it with you.
I brought it with me,
I put it in the back seat, right?
And I looked in the front seat and the trunk.
That's bizarre.
Cause I know you brought it.
Cause I made fun of you.
What, what are you looking at?
That's my jacket.
Marla's wearing my jacket.
She took my jacket from the car?
What is that?
Maybe she was walking by and saw it in the back seat.
Okay, well, it's not a big deal.
Let's not make it a big deal.
Everyone?
Congratulations.
I mean it just couldn't have been more perfect.
Yeah, good, good.
Brr.
Whew.
That's actually my jacket.
Oh.
Yeah, me too. That's why I went to the car to get the jacket.
Cause earlier in fact, before we came,
I was taking the coat and Cheryl was mocking me for wearing a coat, cause it's freezing, you know.
I had the foresight to bring the coat.
You know what I mean?
Cause I knew it's the beach, it gets chilly on the beach.
Larry, do you want the jacket back?
Here you go.
All right, okay, okay.
Wow.
Wowie.
Better?
What the hell is this?
It might have been.
That's not gonna wash out.
I'll take the jacket with me.
I can wash it. It'll be fine.
I can't stand them.
You know what I mean?
You move on. You don't worry about.
You don't think about it.
How could I sit there freezing to death while she's wearing my jacket?
She's a perfectly healthy woman wearing my jacket, I'm freezing.
Larry, they got engaged tonight, okay?
This was not about you.
It was not about your stupid jacket.
They got engaged.
Yeah, that's true.
Why would you even say that?
Well then, she should have brought her own jacket.
I was the only one who anticipated that it was going to be cold.
And I should be rewarded for that foresight, not punished.
I did not ask her directly for the jacket.
If I say don't say anything, do you know what that means?
Yes yes, Mom, yeah.
I didn't say anything.
You know how you said that you were the smart pig?
But the thing about the smart pig that made his house of bricks, he protected the other little pigs that came over.
Okay? He watched over them and helped them, cause he was a generous pig.
Pig?
What pig?
I don't know what pig is.
You know,
The Three Little Pigs.
One built his house with bricks.
I'm the pig with the bricks.
When did it happen?
In the news?
No, this is a fairy tale.
I owe you money.
Can you believe I bet the Clippers?
What kind of moron am I?
That is your fault, not mine.
I said don't, you did it.
A jerk.
Mmm.
They're getting three and a half points.
All right, come on in for a second.
You can come in. look who's here.
He's as fat as a house.
My god, look at the size of him.
What kind of thing is that to say?
You'll hurt his feelings.
Like he knows what
I'm talking about.
He knows.
You don't call a dog fat.
You go around calling Jeff a fat fuck.
Jeff is a fat fuck.
Oscar is just big boned.
He's not fat, he's lean.
He's just right.
What do you feed the dog?
Food, you know, dog food.
Cheryl, Susie, Oscar.
Nice to meet you.
He's a beautiful dog. the dog's fat?
Why? Because he is fat.
He's gained about 25 Ibs.
You don't tell her that.
You can think that, tell me even.
I don't get the whole dog thing anyway.
It's like having a bum living in your house.
When everybody hates me, my dog loves me.
Hey, stop the car for a second.
Remember when I smashed into it?
He didn't fix it.
I'll be right back.
Oy, perfect.
I was driving by the restaurant and I couldn't help but notice you haven't fixed the dent on the car.
No, I didn't fix the dent.
Hmm.
May I ask why?
Considering it's none of your business,
I had better use for the money.
You gave me my money.
I can do with that money what I please.
Are these pickles?
They're mine.
All right.
Man, take it easy.
Pfft, boy, that went well.
He said he has no intention of getting the car fixed.
He gave the money to his daughter, said she needed it.
Well, that's a big bowl of wrong.
Hello?
Hey, honey.
Hey, ask her how the Knicks did.
When?
You're kidding me?
Well, where are you?
All right, I'll be there in like 10 minutes.
Oscar went into the pantry, had three boxes of Oreos and now he's gonna die.
I told you you're feeding that dog too much.
I don't feed him Oreos.
I'll be in the examining room.
Just wait out here. I'll be back.
Excuse me?
Yeah, they lost by four.
Larry?
He's gonna be fine.
The one who ruined my jacket?
That Marla?
Well, give it to me.
What are you opening it for?
It's already open now.
She's my friend.
Marla.
There's a check.
What?
A check. $150.
Wow.
This is quite a gesture.
I had her pegged all wrong, I think.
I'll keep the check.
It can really screw up the books, these things.
I'm impressed that you even realize what a nice gesture that is.
I'm not afraid to apologize.
Most people, I have to say, and my mother always used to tell me this,
Most people aren't like you, Larry.
Most people are not like you.
You're special.
You know?
Everybody's not like me.
No, they're not, no.
That's what she did.
And I have to say,
The poor dog is fighting for his life, you know,
I love that dog.
If anything ever happened that freaking dog.
I don't know.
What you got up your sleeve?
Is that what this is about?
Daytime sex?
I love daytime sex.
Then you can just go on with the rest of the day
Oscar.
Oscar, where the fuck are you?
Jeff, look in the garden shed.
Have you see Oscar?
Was he outside?
We sedated him yesterday at the vet.
He was lying in the backyard and now he's gone.
No one's going to kidnap a sedated dog.
Well, where the fuck is he, Jeff?
God.
Oscar.
This is crazy.
Yeah?
He's got a flower shop.
I gotta pay off my Knick loss.
I'll suss it out.
I'll feel it out.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
You shouldn't have brought it up.
He didn't kidnap and eat your dog, okay?
I got it taken care of.
The beach is a good idea.
Yeah, tell Mark
I said hi.
Okay. Bye.
Who has a wedding on the beach?
Mark and Marla?
Will you say hi to me or are you gonna dis me?
No, I don't dis people.
Unbelievable.
How come you never have cash, Larry?
I got a check from Marla made out to me for $150.
What?
No, not liking, not liking,
Sung, loving.
Celtics.
I knew it, 'cause I think the same thing as you.
I think it.
You're gonna win.
Ohh,
What are you eating, Sung?
Larry, this is fresh meat.
It's quite delectable.
What kind of meat?
The best kind.
He's a good dog.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Okay.
Heineman's here?
I didn't see him,
I just saw the car.
What's with the hat?
What?
I'm married,
You look like you should be pulling a rickshaw.
They're all over the place.
Big bosoms everywhere you look.
Mark obviously invited a lot of his clients.
Of course, of course.
Is that Heineman's daughter?
Yeah. No wonder why the car's there.
Heineman told me that he took the money
I gave him, the $1500 and gave it to his daughter and didn't tell me why.
I paid for those things.
You paid for those giant fake titties.
Come on, man.
What is that? What's up with that?
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
You've undergone quite a transformation since the last time
I saw you.
Let me just say this, okay?
Less is more.
It's just my opinion.
Well, thank you for your opinion.
But we thought they would be festive if they were appropriately sized.
That's a festival if I ever saw one.
All right, whatever.
You went a little big. Were you drunk at the time you did this thing?
He thinks they're too big.
This is completely natural, Larry.
It's not about subtlety, Larry, it's about excellence and confidence.
Yeah, I gave your father a check for the car, $1500.
He gave it to you for this.
Exactly.
Excuse me.
Larry?
Larry, what's wrong?
I'm getting a little chilly.
Mark, do you take this woman, Marla, to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold until death do you part?
I do.
And do you, Marla, take this man, Mark, to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold in sickness and in health until death do you part?
You have got to be kidding me.
Where's the new jacket,
Larry?
I sent you $150.
Did you receive it?
Well, I didn't buy a new jacket.
It's my money. I can do whatever
I want with it, no?
I don't need to buy a new jacket just 'cause you say.
Did you read the memo of the check I sent you, Larry?
It said, replace fleece jacket.
Replace fleece jacket.
Unbelievable.
Have you ever tasted anything like this in your life?
It's fantastic.
Hmm.
The Korean florist brought it.
Oscar.
Hey, pulgoki's Oscar.
You're eating a dog.
Drink of water here.
We're eating Oscar.
Holy shit, it's Oscar.
Larry. Larry.
It's kind of small in there.
Yeah, but it's not for you it's for your nanny, right?
It's for my nanny. You're right.
All right, how much?
Whatever you think is fair.
I'm shocked.
I'll find the blue book value and that's what I'll give you.
Louis Lewis has just come out of his coma.
Yeah, no, invite anybody you want.
Yeah, let's go all the way.
Okay, I'll see you tonight. All right, bye.
I'm going to a party tonight my friends are throwing for me 'cause I'm getting out of here, and I would like you to go with me.
Wow.
Hey, what are you gonna do about your cousin who needs a kidney?
I'm not giving anybody my kidney. I just woke up.
I'm gonna give things out now?
You know, I heard that you come in and out of here all the time and I don't understand that.
I hardly know you.
I met you briefly once at Ritchie's house and they tell me you're in here all the time.
I visit people in the hospital and I cheer them up. I go around, I do volunteer work.
It pays to be in a coma, I'm telling you.
They go into hibernation, they come out like new bears.
Everybody should do this.
You should've seen him walking down that hall.
It was like the specter of death.
And then he passed me and he looked at me.
I'm haunted by that look.
No.
I can't find it anywhere.
No, I didn't do anything with it.
If you're blaming this on me, you're barking up the wrong tree, okay?
I have a system.
When I watch a DVD, I put the case on top of the DVD player.
Then when I'm done, I take the DVD,
I put it back in the case, and then I put it back on the shelf.
Well, your system's breaking down.
Well, you're the one, probably, who took it out and didn't put it back.
Don't blame it on me.
I mean, I'm not even that friendly with him.
Yeah, I know him 44 years, but we're not really close friends.
He's more of an acquaintance.
Who gives a kidney to an acquaintance?
Do you have any sympathy at all for what I'm going through?
It doesn't seem like you do. Okay?
All right, thanks.
That was Omar Jones.
Turns out you were right.
You are, in fact, adopted.
Now your biological parents are Mr And Mrs Cone, and they currently reside in Bisbee, Arizona.
They're awaiting your call.
Please notice this aircraft has three emergency exits located in the rear, center and forward sections of the cabin.
I can't really sit here by the emergency door exit.
We will go down.
All we need to know is that you're willing to assist passengers in the event of a nontraditional landing.
I can't read that brochure. It's Chinese to me.
It's just an expression.
I don't think you are Chinese. You look maybe Thai?
Is it the seat or are you just scared to fly?
I couldn't even hit the rim.
Cause I was choking.
Choking.
Sir, how about I get you a drink? Would you like a Merlot?
No thank you, I don't drink. I don't drink.
I'll look for a seat for you but you owe me one, Mister.
Thank you.
I mean, it's ridiculous. I don't want to sit here.
Who the hell knows how to do this thing?
What, pull down? What is that gonna do?
Can I pull down? Do you have to be strong? I don't even know.
Then what do you do? You smash this thing?
What happens then? The door just suddenly opens miraculously?
You're not Chinese. You don't look Chinese.
What are you, Thai? I think you're thai. You're thai?
I knew it.
Gosh. Come on in.
And, before long, we had a baby.
You remember anything about the people who you, what, adopted me?
Fidgety guy?
Kind of talked like that a little bit?
He did kind of.
I remember that, yeah.
And she was lovely, but she was a little loud.
You wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of her, though.
Been here for hundreds of years.
I'm gentile.
Hey look, Dave. Hi Dave, how you doing?
We do now.
You're gonna like it here.
I noticed you're selling your car here.
Yep, lettin' her go.
You interested?
Well, no I'm not. But may I ask how you arrived at that price?
Sure, that's the actual blue book value.
Ouch.
Larry, what's wrong?
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
That's what Jesus would do.
Hey, I gotta bite, pop.
You did it.
Good, son.
We have, we have to say grace first, Larry.
Dear Lord, we thank you for this bountiful meal.
We thank you for the love of each other.
All right, nose, toes, I'll just move my wallet to the right side.
One, two, three, four. I kind of like that.
Right, that's it. You have it. Yeah.
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born.
While sheperds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born.
My friends,
We have our family.
We have our husbands, wives, children, and all the extended relatives of that family.
But there is another bond, and that is the bond of friendship.
Think of all that it implies.
The caring, the compassion, the devotion to loyalty, and above all, perhaps, to the generosity of spirit.
We must all ask ourselves, am I a good friend?
Am I giving the friend in need what he needs most? or have I let my own selfish needs stand in the way of being his best friend.
Please notice this aircraft has three emergency exits located in the rear, center and forward sections of the cabin.
Passengers seated in these exit rows agree to assist in the event of emergency.
You can depend on me, maam.
Sure.
Nice day for flight.
Have you always had this?
Yeah, I've had these for a while, you know.
I borrowed this from my friend a few weeks ago and I played out of my mind with it.
I've been looking all over for this.
You can't even get them anymore.
My god, I love this putter.
Mmm, I don't think so.
What?
I'm not going to do anything. I'll take really good care of it, believe me.
Come on, I'll take good care of it, I promise.
What?
I still love you.
God bless you.
Jesus Christ.
Cheryl?
How are you?
What?
I love you. I love you.
What are you wearing? Is this a sweater vest?
I want to have children.
Lots of them.
Well, let's talk about that.
We can talk about it tonight over dinner.
Okay.
And then I'll tell you all about them.
I know why God saved me from drowning a few months ago.
Why?
He wanted me to give Lewis my kidney.
And I'm going to.
Gotta say, man, you are very, very calm, bro.
God will watch over me.
Hmm. He didn't watch over the last guy.
But you're a lucky man.
You're giving away a kidney.
The recipient is going to love you, man. is what it is. You could be in China and sneeze and he'll bring you a tissue.
Well, that may be true of others. I don't think with him, though.
He wouldn't even loan me a putter, actually.
You're giving him a kidney, he wouldn't loan you his putter?
Well, you know people get very attached to their golf clubs.
That's fucked up, man.
Larry, I gotta tell ya,
I'm too weak to really express it and articulate it, but this is the greatest thing that anyone's ever done for me.
I'll do anything for you for the rest of your life.
Just ask me anything and I'll do it for you, I promise.
Anything except loan him your putter.
You told him about the putter?
No, it was an innocent conversation.
The Cones, they're not your parents.
You're not adopted.
Good luck with the surgery.
Get me out of here. Get me the fuck out of here.
Hey, stay here. What are you doing?
You're the best. You're the best.
You paid me $5,000 less than the blue book.
I looked in the wrong book, I guess, um.
I'll give the $5,000 to Cheryl.
Okay.
See?
This is what you get from doing good deeds.
I avoided good deeds my whole life.
Turns out I was right.
You're right.
Larry, the rabbi is here.
The rabbi.
Rabbi.
Larry, what can I say?
I'm still young, Rabbi.
That's the one thing I had going for me.
Larry, is your house in order?
I mean you should have everything settled by now.
My business manager, Matt.
I supposed I could have traveled more.
I went to Europe once.
No big deal.
The truth is, Rabbi, I can't stand packing.
You know, Larry, we all have moments in our life when we've acted out of thoughtlessness and we've been inconsiderate to other people.
Is there anybody, right now, that you can think of you'd like to ask for forgiveness and make right with?
When you walk through my door, you play by my rules.
You take off your fucking shoes.
Devoted sister? Beloved cunt?
He's a racist.
You fucked up.
Larry, you ate the baby Jesus and his mother Mary.
She called the cops on you.
See, if this were yours it would say, fucking douche bag.
You need a good fucking ass kicking.
That's what you need.
You want to name our baby Tang?
Hey. Hold the door.
No, this is my jacket.
What are you, crazy?
This is ours. This is ours.
You're a disgrace to your people.
Fuck you.
Motherfucker, what the fuck?
Larry, you piece of shit.
Get out right now.
Good boy.
Banzai.
Nah.
Jeff.
You know,
I've never said anything, but I've noticed, you use way too much mayo.
You know, when they make tuna, there's already mayo in it.
You don't have to put it on the bread.
I'll use less mayo, I promise.
I really looked like an asshole.
Okay.
Dad.
You want a doctor?
A doctor?
Lar.
Cheryl.
Sure.
Is there anything else?
It couldn't have been me.
I have a system.
I have a system.
Larry?
Is there anything you can tell me about his will?
He manipulated Jeff. Jeff had no choice but to say yes.
I just heard him say it was the blue book value on it.
He's petty in life, he's petty in death.
Cheryl, you have a lot of money.
He did not rip him off.
Hello.
We're your guides.
We've been watching you your whole life.
Please.
You did die.
You know Larry, you've got a lot of fans up here.
Get outta here.
Larry, Marilyn Monroe was a huge fan of the Seinfeld show.
She's very much looking forward to meeting you.
Marilyn Monroe?
It's your mother, Larry.
Say hello to your mother.
What kind of schmuck are you?
I mean, who goes around giving their kidney to people?
Idiot.
And I'm surprised that your father let you do such a thing.
Wait till I see him again.
Why did you tell dad not to bother me when you died?
That's what I wanna know.
I'm not done with you yet, Buster.
Hey, Larry.
Come here.
Ben Hogan.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
You know, I've been watching your golf game.
You're moving your feet.
I know, Ben. I move my feet.
Yeah, you know that sex offender had a good tip for you.
I can't do it, Ben.
I can't. I've tried.
Why don't you come out with me? We'll shoot 18.
I'll show you how it's done, huh?
We got great courses up here.
I'm playing golf with Ben Hogan.
It's called heaven.
Come on.
Yes, I always wanted to ask you about that.
You should've stayed.
Are there restaurants? Are there movies?
Like, how does that work?
What do you do here all day?
Yeah, Larry, listen.
We're your guides.
We can't actually control events.
Why do I even need you? What does a guide do?
I don't even get it.
And what about going to the bathroom?
Because, I notice I've been here a while and frankly I don't have to do anything.
Pretty good.
Any idea?
Did you look behind the couch, Larry?
Did you once look behind the couch, Larry?
Because you had a system.
That's right. I have a system.
And the people that misplace the DVD's
Mr Great guide who let me do that tv guide cover.
Okay, all right, okay. Take it easy. Just come over here and relax.
You're just not ready.
Okay, maybe it isn't much of a system.
You're right, it's not. It's a bad system.
It's not a good system.
Goodbye, Larry.
Give me another chance.
Wait wait, I like it here.
I'm not paying. I'm not paying.
Look, I'm not paying it. I'm not.
You notice how in the movies they never fold when they're packing?
They just throw everything in.
Well, still, you have to pack the right way.
I'm not buying that.
You look good. you know?
You know, I gotta talk to the doctor.
Do you have to get clearance for that?
I think you do.
Needless to say, I'm quite prepared.
Okay. All right.
How do you feel?
You feel different after all this?
You know, yeah.
You get to leave in a wheelchair.
Hmm, all right.
Very excited about this.
Hello.
What's with the walking here?
I had to use the bathroom.
Okay, I get it.
That one was occupied.
I had to duck in here for a second.
It was a bit of an emergency.
Well then you wait.
You wait.

What is that?
I don't know.
What is that, a cell phone?
The smoke alarm's going off.
It's the stupid batteries.
Come on, we've gotta find it.
No, it's not that one.
It's not that one.
No.
Try the guest room.
I think it's downstairs.
I don't think
I have any feeling in my shoulders,
I swear to God.
No, seriously, for a guy who doesn't play,
I thought he did very well. You did.
You never play.
Just pick up the ball.
He's right, yeah.
Didn't you have fun with us, hanging out?
It was a little boring, to be honest with you.
Okay, give me back my $150 that I spent on your guest fee.
You paid $150 for me to look like a fucking asshole?
More shocking footage from Hurricane Edna
The storm surge
That's from globaI warming, that hurricane. 33 deaths have been reported and thousands left homeless. thousands of homeless people now.
Did you go to Funkhouser's party last night?
No. Did you?
Why?
I don't want to go to two parties back to back.
It was a stupid night for him to have a party.
No.
You're gonna use your child to get out of a party?
I wish I had that.
It's one of the bonuses, yep.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna say?
I'll just show up tonight and pretend I had the wrong night.
Where's the party?
He's not gonna buy that.
That's such obvious bullshit.
He's gotta be a mentaI case to believe it.
No, I love that.
That's fantastic.
Have you ever seen Richard look in the mirror?
Is that really what I do? to a sport forever.
I have to ask Cha Cha. I'll see.
Where did he get her from?
Okay. What are you gonna wear?
I'm gonna dress like a little Dutch girI.
What am I wearing?
I mean, the pictures on TV you can't even imagine that people survived it.
I know, it's awfuI.
AwfuI. I was watching it today. they have no place to go right now.
Hey. go ahead, move in.
You know what my father used to call those people?
Did I ever tell you that?
I've been doing a little research and we could actually have a family here tomorrow.
I would need a couple of months to mentally prepare for that.
Tomorrow?
We don't have a couple of months.
These people need help right now.
We don't need to jump into this thing right now.
Imagine how they would feeI to come here and live in our house.
We're at Funkhousers.
Why aren't we just going to Ted and Mary's, Larry?
There's nothing to it. We'll just pretend we had the wrong night. we attempted to go to his party.
Can't we just go to Ted and Mary's?
We're gonna go to Ted and Mary's after we do this.
It won't take long.
It's two minutes.
What happened to you guys?
Where where is everybody?
Yeah, obviously.
Everyone else was here.
You know what? I swear
I had a feeling. I really had a feeling.
No, look look look look look, you're here come on in.
Come on.
What? Get out of here.
We don't want to impose on you.
You're not imposing.
You're tired from last night.
You were up late with your party.
Come on in.
No, but it's crazy.
Come on, CheryI.
Come on.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Come on.
Come on, Larr.
Come on, Larry.
Yeah, well, we didn't wanna miss it.
Let me tell you what we did.
We had an hour and a half of the greatest improv karaoke singing
And you know what?
Come on, sit down.
I'm okay with it.
And stop feeling bad.
We're here now.
You know what game I love that we didn't play last night?
I go get the sticks,
I throw them all over the room and we pick up the sticks.
And the one with the most sticks wins the pot.
Yeah, what is this?
You got company?
Are you guys expecting company?
Where's everybody? the party was last night.
Well, guess who else thought it was tonight?
Who?
They had the wrong night just like us.
We're gonna have a little
We'll all go.
No, don't go anywhere.
Listen to me.
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't steaI it.
I give you full credit.
It's a brilliant idea.
Ever. And who's ever had more cake than me?
What is the deaI? I've never tasted anything like that.
Wait, I need 26th Street Bakery, we got it.
My daughter is waiting for a puppet show.
Your dad always has a virus, okay?
You guys stay here, keep him company.
You stay.
You guys were supposed to be here to go to a party, right?
You got nothing going on.
Father sick, tomorrow you'll take your puppets over to his father's house and make him feeI better, okay?
We're gonna have fun.
And guess what our next move is. and we're gonna play
Yes, that's great.
Do I know my husband?
That was great.
If you could have sex with one of your friends wives or girlfriends, who would it be?
Ooh.
I will say, CheryI, that you are adorable.
Thank you.
Susie, you dress great.
Yeah, well, that's my forte, Marty.
But when I really think about it,
What are you talking about?
I don't have a thing for Cha Cha.
Richard's girlfriend? to have sex with Cha Cha.
I don't want to have sex with her.
I'm answering the question.
You love your wives.
I love it.
Come on, honey.
I don't care about Cha Cha.
I was trying to win the game.
You thought she was sexy. I thought that's what you would write down.
CheryI, come on. come on, what can I do?
What can I do?
I'll do anything. Come on.
Anything?
Well, you know, short of adopting this hurricane family.
I can't wait to get to the airport to see the family.
We'll finally get to meet them.
The guy on the phone was saying how excited they were when they got on the plane
I can't wait to see what they look like.
Yeah.
I just want to make one quick stop before we go.
What are you guys doing? what's going on?
I'm actually glad to hear this.
I was a little pissed off that you didn't call.
You're kidding.
Can you believe how stupid we are?
This is fantastic.
You're gonna come in and help us eat it.
I'll call you tomorrow and we'll get together.
Hey, Larr, you don't have any plans, you're supposed to be here, you're here.
Come on in.
Come in, CheryI. It'll be fun.
This'll be fun. We've got leftovers.
We'll make an omelet.
It'll be great.
Come on.
This is like pulling teeth.
Come on in, you guys.
I don't know.
Can you still see it? got around to taking it out, it turns out I could have almost broken my jaw really undersold the magnitude of it, I think.
You're behaving like
Of course I want to be here.
I was raised not to intrude on people. horrified if she knew that I was sitting in the living room the night after a big party horrified.
I left the car running.
If you walk away from the car, it's on, and you got your car keys in your hand, it goes beep beep beep beep beep.
No, it doesn't go beep beep beep beep beep.
Yeah, it does go beep beep beep beep beep, Larry.
Okay, I'm gonna go check the car.
You check the car.
You stay where you are.
I'll get it.
This is ridiculous.
You know Cha Cha, right? for the party?
Yeah, see, you made a mistake.
You think that the party is tonight, but it was actually last night.
You know, Larry and CheryI made the exact same mistake you did. they made the exact same mistake you did, Larry.
They thought the party was tonight. Interesting.
Yeah, it is interesting.
Can I get you guys a drink?
What did you steaI my thing for?
What, do you have a fucking copyright on this stupid little thing?
You're making a fooI out of me.
He's onto me now.
I got 35 calls.
Don't ever say to anyone you want
The Newlywed Game.
What does that have to do with I want to have intercourse with Cha Cha?
I wanted to win the game. Do you even know what I'm talking about?
Okay, you know what?
I can't stay in the same house as him.
We're gonna go. Come on.
No no no, you know what?
I should go.
Good night.
Look at them.
Hi.
Are you waiting for the Davids by any chance?
Well, you know, you'll see, in Los Angeles it's terrible.
It's like if my last name was Jew, cause I'm Jewish.
Well, we really do appreciate y'all letting us stay with you.
We really do appreciate it.
Thank you, thank you.
My goodness.
And spacious too.
What do you think, huh?
It's a swank place you got here, Larry, very swank.
Go go, you go take a look around.
Mm mm. This is a nice place.
Fixtures going
I can't believe this.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Let's have a party.
What?
A party?
We do. A chocolate layered cake.
I think it was the best cake we've ever had.
This is where Marty buys his cakes? served us penis.
Thank you very much, sir.
It was one of the scariest things
I've ever experienced in my lifetime.
I hope we're not too rude, but we showed up
Let me ask you a question.
How come you didn't tell me that I was eating
Yeah.
Well, I told you it was a black log cake.
Yeah, still,
I was eating a black penis.
You didn't mention it.
Well, eating a black penis is not appetizing to everybody.
I think that's unfair.
Why did you take the balls home?
I didn't know they were balls.
Excuse me.
Yes, it was you.
I was just trying to win
The Newlywed Game is all.
Look, I'm over it.
No, because it was
Jeff.
Jeff, the cake.
Jeff.
My friend Jeff did not know that there was a penis in that box when he picked that up from the bakery.
He called in the order and they gave him the box.
He didn't look inside the box.
How's Keysha?
I finally got her to sleep.
She's upset.
Of course.
Of course she's upset.
Understandable. what are you gonna do?
She's a little girI.
How's the cake?
Good night.
Holy moly.
What happened?
What are you doing here?
The party was yesterday.
What?
Yesterday.
This house feels like a hoteI to me.
She's right about that.
It's not as nice as the other house.
I agree with you.
It's not as nice.
Hi, Ted. I know.
No no, we're here.
We're in the middle of it right now.
I know.
Can you believe it?
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's unbelievable.
And when they're together, she goes like this. She gives him a slap.
I'm done helping you move.
You know, they're naming a wing after me.
Where's Loretta?
Loretta.
Peanut, Peanut, boy.
Look at you, boy.
Do I smell food?
Come here, Auntie.
What's up, girI?
Which room he gonna stay in?
All right.
Come on, boy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CheryI.
Boy, I don't know.
I wonder if cooking good is hereditary.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, see, Loretta put her foot in it this time.
Loretta put her foot in it, turned it around, and kicked you in your own asshole.
You feeI me?
Watch your mouth in front of the children.
Looks good, don't it, don't it?
Come on, all that cholesteroI.
It's no good for you.
Larry, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm gonna think about eating it.
You crazy, girI.
I'm a little creeped out right now.
There's a stain on the blanket.
You know, and does his business, and he's alone.
Hey, everybody in the family have them big ones.
Okay,
I'm gonna talk to him.
You can't talk to him about it.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse me, ladies.
All right.
Man, I'm about to bust.
Stain on my blanket, huh?
What, like juice,
What kind of stain was it?
Ejaculate.
Ajackalit.
Not ajackalit.
Ejaculate.
Ejaculate?
It couldn't have been mine.
Know why? 'cause I gets mine, Larry.
I brings the ruckus to the ladies.
Is that it?
First of all, look around this place, man.
Are there any visuals around here to jack off to?
All we have is basic cable, right?
What am I doing, jacking off to Andy Griffith?
Jacking off to Clara, huh?
I don't know Clara.
I know Aunt Bea.
Nobody wanna jack off to no damn Aunt Bea.
I don't remember any beauties on that show, frankly.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You want me to clean the blanket.
I don't have a bin, Larry.
I have to look at it to see what kind
Larry, do you want me to clean the blanket or not?
What are you doing?
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.
Sure, Larry, whatever you say.
Larry, I could give a shit if it was
Santa Claus. I'm just trying to get it off.
No, I'm just telling you, okay, that I had nothing to do with that.
You look very cute when you're all blushy.
I'm not gonna lie about that.
You're really insane, you know?
Larry.
What?
What? It happens, Larry.
No no no, you don't understand.
That's Joe Pepitone's jersey.
Well, do you think they'll return it?
Larry, in all the many years
That's just the unwritten law of dry cleaning.
Everyone knows that.
Of course he denied it, but I mean, come on, give me a break.
He was in the room.
I mean, who else could it be?
You gotta kick him out, hands down.
First night in the house.
Hey hey, I did it.
Come on, no big deaI.
You did it?
Yeah, did it, yep, me.
What's the big deaI?
Feeling good, and I was away from the table.
I got an erection.
I took care of it before I came back.
You're like a monkey.
They were doing the four questions and I love the four questions.
Gotta get back.
It's very important.
Come to my house and do it.
What do I give a shit?
Come on over and whack off.
I left my sunglasses at your house.
I need 'em desperately.
See the new wing?
Call me, actually.
Why are you and Ted always kind of hitting each other all the time?
All this playfuI hitting?
All that stuff?
It's not a conscious thing.
I don't know.
I'm expressive with my hands.
That's pretty good.
Pretty good.
What is that?
Wing Donated By Anonymous.
I'm not crazy about that.
As opposed to, you know,
Mr WonderfuI Anonymous.
I know who it is.
It's Ted.
Ted is Anonymous.
What are you, kidding?
No, isn't that great?
He donated a whole wing and didn't want anybody to know.
He told me, okay?
Who else did he tell?
How do you know he just told you?
The point is that he didn't need all the fanfare
Fanfare? What fanfare?
I don't like the fanfare.
You're saying
I like fanfare?
He can tell a few people. He just doesn't need the whole world to know that he donated all this money.
You know what? I didn't need the world to know, either.
Nobody told me that I could be anonymous and tell people.
I would have taken that option, okay?
You can't have it halfway.
You're either anonymous or you're not. the guy who has to have his name up on the wall, as opposed to Mr Anonymous, but was really Ted.
It's fake philanthropy, and it's faux anonymity.
I'll be right back.
Senator, I wanted to talk to you about an issue that doesn't really get a lot of play in the papers.
Well, tell me 'cause
I like new issues.
Okay, I'm talking about what's going on at the dry cleaners.
What's going on at the dry cleaners, Larry?
And there's no oversight.
It's just complete chaos in the dry cleaning industry, as I see it.
Yeah, well, it's not balancing out for me, senator.
I never get an item, and you know what?
If I got it,
I would return it, because I think the whole system is flawed.
Larry, you see these slacks?
See 'em?
Dry cleaners.
Well, they're mine now.
You look fabulous.
They couldn't swim in the bay. they could swim in?
That wasn't available to them at the time?
Well, you know, could I just say, that aside, look at this.
Anonymous.
Larry, did you know this anonymous is Ted?
You didn't need to do this.
But that's why
I kept my name off, because I think it's the exhibit.
It's the issue that needs to stand forward, not me.
You know, too many people don't do things out they want the credit.
I've gotta run.
Bye, Larry. Bye, Ted.
Wow, wow.
If you're Anonymous, how come people know about it?
I told maybe one or two people, friends that I didn't think
I wanted to have a secret.
I have a feeling everybody in this room knows.
Can I have your attention, everybody?
We're gonna start the ceremony and senator Barbara Boxer would like
Larry David.
Are you aware of that?
Next time I give money to anybody it'll be anonymous,
I can tell you that.
And I'm going to tell everybody.
I know who the masturbator was.
That's really unbelievable.
And by the way,
Jeff is banned from our house.
He is not welcome in our house anymore.
I'd rather have the masturbator in the house than the gossiper.
Well, you obviously weren't going to tell me, Larry.
I would have told you on the way home or waited untiI I got in the house, guess who jerked off on our blanket?
It was Jeff. Isn't that hilarious?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a fun ride home.
Heya, what's going on?
CheryI found out about the stain on the blanket.
How could she find out?
You didn't tell her.
No.
Ted Danson?
Yeah, her girlfriend Ted.
That's crazy.
Now how am I gonna look CheryI in the eye?
How can the four of us ever go out again?
What do you mean CheryI banned you from the house?
Don't try to bullshit me.
Why, what happened?
What's gonna happen if I don't tell?
I'll call CheryI and find out.
You what?
You jerked off in their house?
You have wrought your semen outside our home, Jeff?
You masturbate in this house and this house alone. Maybe a hoteI.
Not at a friend's house.
I have to agree with her, really.
You know what, Larry?
I can handle this.
He's my husband.
Shut the fuck up, okay?
And CheryI kicked him out?
Who the fuck is she to tell my husband what to do?
Ban him from the house?
I will take care of you in my own way.
And you know what?
Jeff is banned from your house?
You are banned from my house.
Get the fuck out.
Be gone with you.
Out.
If he's banned, you're banned.
Don't come back.
Don't worry, I won't.
I will take you out.
The days are over where you been terrorizing my people.
Ghost is not the first thing you think about.
Come on, are you kidding?
Scared me half to death, Larry.
Okay, you can get off now.
Hey, Jeff's sunglasses.
What are you doing?
You want to take a ride with me?
I gotta return Jeff's sunglasses.
He left them here.
All right, Larry.
Hold on.
Give me two minutes, Larry.
Jeff been jackin' off?
That's the jackoff suspect, huh?
Yeah.
I know. I owe you one.
You damn right you owe me one.
Okay.
In the Yankee jersey. my jersey. Joe Pepitone.
He never gave it back.
Be cooI, Larry. I'm gonna get that shit back for you.
Leon.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how I do it, baby.
Ha ha ha. Joe Pepitone up in this motherfucker.
Jesus.
Nice goin', man.
What do you want?
Jeff's glasses.
Found them in my house.
All right, fine, thank you.
Think I could use your bathroom?
No, a ban is a ban. What, does my word mean nothing?
I really gotta go.
All right, I will temporarily lift the ban.
BeautifuI.
Thank you.
What the fuck?
Ow. in fourth grade?
Get me a new blanket, new bed, all that shit?
Leon, I'm not getting you a new bed.
Come on, man.
That's crazy.
Joe Pepitone jersey.
This is unbelievable.
Is it possible there's two of these things?
No, mine's 42.
This can't be my jersey.
That's my jersey.
Okay, well let's get the right shirt then.
How 'bout that?
All right, I can handle that right now.
That guy right there.
It's his shirt.
We're definitely taking the damn shirt.
Larry David?
Hey hey hey.
Hey.
Hey, did you send that guy over to take my jersey?
Well, I didn't really send him.
He kind of went off on his own.
He just took the jersey off my back.
I don't think it's really your jersey, though, is it, Merle?
What do you mean?
I was wearing it.
Did you get that jersey from the dry cleaner?
I got it from the dry cleaner.
Okay, Merle, that jersey is my jersey.
I brought it into that dry cleaner and they gave it to you by mistake.
I never get any stuff from the dry cleaner.
The only mistakes they make with me are to give my stuff to other people.
That's not my fault.
I've lost tons of stuff at the dry cleaners.
I lost drapes.
If you got a problem with this why don't you just write your congressperson?
Yeah, well I spoke to senator Boxer.
And what did she say?
Okay, you know what?
I'm on the board at the NRDC and your name's coming off that wall.
How would you like that?
And why don't you put up Anonymous instead?
I will.
That's a perfect idea.
You come by there next Monday,
It's gonna say Anonymous on the wall.
Okay.
Joe Pepitone.
We got a matching set, man.
Mom.
What's wrong,
Sammy, darling?
Mmm. Bam.
Bam.
I declare war.
Boom. Aw.
All right.
What'd I get?
Take it.
Peanut, grab that door.
Get the door, Peanut.
I just want to do my thing, Larry.
What is your thing?
I'm gonna be
Action movies, all that stuff, man.
You know you can't just go right into that.
This is a new low, even for you, Larry.
Huh?
Are you crazy?
It's that jackalit, right?
Who the fuck is this?
That's Leon,
Loretta's brother.
What's up what's up, what's up what's up? Mmm.
That's beside the point, Leon.
This is sick, this is perverse, and I think this is the lowest you've ever gone.
Who's anonymous, then?
Well, he told me, but he told me not to tell anybody.
That's how he likes to do it.
Makes him feeI better about himself.
That is just disgusting.
What a perv, man.
Actors.
Boom. War.
I declare
I'll get it.
Ted, it's Susie for you.
I wonder what she wants.
Hey, I wanted to tell you I heard that you took your name off the NRDC building and had it replaced with Anonymous.
Kathy, I get plenty of fanfare.
I don't need the fanfare, you know?
As a matter of fact,
I hope you don't mind
That I told a few people that you were the anonymous person.
I hope that's okay that I let that slip out.
Well, I can't really tell you people should know you're anonymous.
It's that guy.
That's the guy.
Hey.
That's the guy.
That's that bald guy that took my jersey.
You gotta let me in.
These people are chasing me.
Sir, the building's closed.
I can't help you.
No no, I'm Larry David.
That's my wing.
I'm Anonymous.
Did you call Funkhouser?
That's terrible, what happened to his mother.
I know.
I mean, driving a wheelchair, getting hit by a car?
Wow. You know, over on Sunset, they got a memorial site all set up for her.
You know what?
He owes me $50 from golf.
That's $50 you're never gonna see.
You can't ask a mourner for $50.
Well, I'm waiting.
Yeah, me too.
What are you waiting for? to offer me condolences for Funkhouser's mother.
Yeah, that's what I'm waiting for from you.
However long you've known him is irrelevant in this equation.
All right, listen,
What's with you?
When's your interview?
I think it's tomorrow.
It would be very nice if Daryl and Keysha went to the same school as Sammy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
How do you know
Sammy's getting in?
Sammy happens to be a very very bright girl.
Yeah, well, Keysha and Daryl are no slouches, either. I can tell you that.
I sit up at night teaching it to 'em.
Let's go.
What the heck?
Yeah, well, on the days
I want sex I'm a lot nicer.
And then we'll have sex.
And then I'll just go back to being the way I am.
What is that banana thing?
I love these people that come here, they get 10 samples, you know?
And it's not right for the woman working back there.
She's got better things to do than just scooping out samples for them.
Look at this. People are waiting.
That's not right.
No, it's not.
You know, I shouldn't be eating ice cream.
I don't know what I came here for. you mind if I go? whatever that is?
Got a long wait.
It's good.
That's a good one.
That's a good one.
Get that. Get that.
And I think I'd like to try the banana, please.
Banana.
You know, you're like a sample abuser.
That's what you are.
Vanilla.
She winds up with vanilla.
You got to be kidding me.
How is the vanilla?
Hey. Funkhouser.
My God,
I can't believe it.
You're out? this helps my emotions.
Jogging's the best thing for me. mourners exercise?
I'm gonna remember that next time
I lose a close member of my family.
Yeah. Jogging.
I called your house.
I left a condolence message.
I never got a return call.
Well, I had a few things on my mind.
I lost my dad a year ago.
My mother just died.
I'm an orphan, okay?
You're a little too old to be an orphan.
No, if you don't have parents you're an orphan.
You could be 70 and be an orphan?
You could be 100 and be an orphan.
Okay.
Little Orphan Funkhouser.
One of the things that bothers me a lot in life, is when ice cream drips down the side of a cone. Doesn't that bother you?
That's why you have to be very vigilant when you're eating ice cream cones.
Look, there's a little drip.
Got it.
Are you coming to the funeral?
Of course I'm coming to the funeral.
Okay, I'm gonna give you the $50
I owe you for the golf bet. about it, the $50.
I got money in the shoe.
Ugh.
Give me a clean 50.
It's perfectly fine.
See? $50.
Hold it out.
Hold it out, fold it up.
Put it in my pocket.
Yeah, okay.
Put it in there.
Thank you.
What flavor did you bring us?
I just kinda got it for Cheryl.
You just brought some ice cream just for Cheryl?
You didn't bring none to share with us?
Well, see, here's the thing.
It's not like it entered my mind and I thought No, the hell with them.
See the difference?
Sin of comission, omission.
That's a sin of omission, much better than the comission.
I think it's an omission and comission thing.
Hey.
Got you ice cream.
Yeah, well, what happened?
Well, this woman was
This woman that he's talking about is the Dean of Admissions at Dryden School.
That nice school we was trying to get the kids in?
Yeah. Now, there's a problem with their application.
But how do you even know about this?
Because I just got a phone call, Larry.
The woman was standing in front of the counter getting sample after sample.
She had 10 samples.
Why you think they get them little, bitty, cute spoons there?
Maybe one or two.
Don't abuse your sampling privilege.
She abused the sampling privilege.
If she had a problem with that woman, don't you think she would say excuse me, maam?
No no. 'Cause she's always told the customer's right.
And in fact, the customer is usually a moron and an asshole.
She was breaking the rules.
That's an unwritten rule.
You tiptoe.
There's no sign, Tiptoe.
You just have to be smart enough and considerate enough to do it.
That's a real good school, Larry.
I'll go apologize.
You know what else?
That's a good start.
I'm down with that.
That's a good one.
Cause I want them kids in that school. rectify it.
I'm a great rectifier.
That's what I do.
I break down,
I rectify.
I've been apologizing to people since I'm six years old on a daily basis.
I pretty much have it down.
Okay, go.
Hey hey, how about a thank you?
Yeah, one scoop for the whole house.
I got you the ice cream.
There's no acknowledgment of that?
Hey, Mr David,
I finished up all the painting. that's a couple hours, 50 bucks.
It's just kind of
Yeah, I don't really punch a clock, right?
You don't want it?
It's a good 50.
You don't want it?
No, I just don't know where you dragged that thing out of.
Fine.
I can give you the 50.
No.
Thank you.
Okay.
I'm gonna get these.
All right.
Those are 35.
Okay.
No.
Hey, Funkhouser.
Call me back. No one's taking this 50.
I can't get rid of it.
I'll be home in an hour.
As you know, my wife and I took in a homeless family who were victims of Hurricane Edna. to bring 'em the ice cream back that perhaps I was a little too impatient in the store with you. completely apologize.
And when I got home, finally, they said,
I really love being called daddy.
I don't particularly like children, like that before in my life.
Daddy, Daddy.
You got the ice cream.
And I said,
Well, you know,
I had a little incident at the ice cream store.
Apology accepted.
I was at fault.
It was me, I was rude.
I was obnoxious,
I'm not such a great person.
It's just really refreshing.
It's really rare.
Saying all that,
I am a pretty good person.
Excuse me one moment.
Kelly.
Could you come in for a sec?
We're gonna need a vase for this.
Fabric samples.
I want this. doesn't know what to do.
I know.
They are all nice, that's the problem.
Yeah, that's what you need to do, you need to pick one, see?
If only it were that simple.
You want them all, you can't have them all.
You still want me to take this one.
I'm home.
One for you and one for you.
What?
My two favorite girls.
Come on, give it up.
Aw.
Thank you.
Yeah, that can wait just one second.
Hey.
Why did you leave that stupid message on my answering machine?
No one will take this money.
I couldn't give it to a bum.
I'm not a violent person.
But if I find this guy,
How would you even know the flowers are missing?
I keep track of it.
I drive by there 10 times a day.
Okay, you know what?
You should go home now.
Don't worry about the 50.
I don't even care about it anymore.
What is that I smell?
What? There's no smell.
What do you mean?
That's a white lily.
I know a white lily.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
There they are.
I knew it.
Where can I find a vase?
Did you take the flowers at my mother's site?
They wouldn't take the 50 at the flower store.
I have never heard anything like that in my life.
Not a graveyard.
It's a roadside memorial.
How could you do this?
And you know what?
I am missing one.
Where's the third bunch?
If you weren't my best friend,
I would take my bare hands and pop your head off your neck.
He's not my best friend.
You better get those flowers. is the other bouquet in the dean's office?
That's great.
And then after
Yes. Belle Fille.
Wait wait wait, you know what?
I really like that too.
Are you looking for anything in particular?
You know what? I'm not, but these are wonderful.
Try that one.
Yeah, those and we've got different ones.
These are two citrus,
Buy it. Buy it. It's a good one.
Get that one.
This is a little bit like peppered with cinnamon.
Good, buy it.
It's good.
You know? You can't sample everything in the world.
It's just impossible.
We'd all like to try everything.
Even though I'd love to, just can't.
There's people in line, people got to go places.
I go to a restaurant, can I get everything on the menu?
I'd love to. Who doesn't want everything on the menu?
You can't, you got to order one thing. That's all.
I'm done.
I'm gonna take that.
Thank you very much.
The sampling thing has got to, you know, we got to put an end to it, you know?
I'd like to be with a lot of women,
I can't sample every woman.
You know what I'm talking about?
I was on line ahead of him.
I was ahead of him.
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have changed lines.
No, I don't want anything else.
You have a line problem in this store.
The lines move completely disproportionately.
You know, there's a way to fix that too.
Like they do in Disneyland, you know, how the line snakes around.
Cause you probably don't add up stuff at the same rate.
There's a way
It's not a crazy idea.
They wouldn't have stoned me back 1000 years ago for bringing up
There's one line, everybody feels good.
They don't feel they're being cheated.
You have a rope, you rope it off, and people move up fair and square.
You know, look at them, look at me.
That's all, one line.
All right.
Correct, yes. And she's having her bat mitzvah this year.
How is that going?
Is she enjoying it?
That's lovely. does she have any? driving by the building. I knew you guys were here for your interview.
I thought we'd go out, have a cup of coffee, discuss the interview.
Cause our kids could be going together.
To apologize to me for being rude, obnoxious and uncivil in the ice cream store.
But he brought me a lovely bouquet of flowers in apology.
Kelly, where are the flowers?
They were just there.
I just put 'em right there.
Well, where did they go?
This is fucking great, Larry.
Now Sammy's kicked out too.
Just knowing you is a liability.
We were in there, we're having the interview, it's nice.
It looks like they're going to accept her.
And then you show up.
I don't know what to say.
You know, these are children's lives we're talking about, Larry.
Their future is in our hands.
You don't understand, you just became a parent.
You have ruined my life.
I am fucked.
And you fucked me.
Hard.
She'll get into another school.
We don't want another school.
We want this school.
We did all our research for this school, man.
Can I have those flowers?
You want the flowers?
Take the fucking flowers.
Is that what this looked like when you stole it?
What?
Problem?
Yeah, a big problem.
No good?
Come on, what?
What's wrong?
They should all stand up. That's what flowers do when they're healthy.
Well, I don't want to make a mess in your house.
Don't worry about it.
You made enough of a mess.
They're friends and relatives from out of town.
They came in for tomorrow's funeral.
Hey.
Hey. to pay my respects go to the funeral.
God, look at these vultures going for that food. they don't even chew.
You know, I bet if you threw a quarter down, there'd be a stampede.
You know that?
I got to get out of here. this whole place, man.
Cheryl, I'm home.
Yeah.
I got the perfume.
Hey, you want to go to my sister's after the service?
Yes, what is that?
That's Mom's perfume.
You're right.
It's like she's here with us.
Thanks again for recommending me for this job.
And Richard says thank you too.
You like 'em?
I could get you a pair.
Nah, that's okay.
I'm going to the bathroom. they don't do just clothes.
They do housewares too, if you're interested. 00 lunch, right?
Yeah, lunch with the wives.
Downstairs, yeah.
See you then.
I wanna be a producer.
How do you become a producer?
You know, you gotta know people.
Great. Okay.
Wow, that was quick.
You don't really need to comment on what's going on
I'm having a hard time getting here on time. What if we carpooled?
You have one of those healthy cars.
How does it work?
You put your foot on the gas.
It was like having a bathroom monitor.
Why don't you go at home, like I do?
I don't like to go in my house.
Who doesn't like to go in their house? she's an environmentalist.
She has this recycled all over the house.
It's like going to the Port Authority
I can't go here and I can't go there.
All right, let's go to lunch.
I love that you have a restaurant in your building.
Again, I want to thank you for Cha Cha.
I apologize for having even recommended her.
Okay? You don't have to lie to me.
No, I wouldn't.
No, she's worked out very well.
You're not gonna hurt my feelings if you fire her.
We're very happy with her.
What can I say? that every time that she's not working, that she's reading or talking
Well, that's her job. She's supposed
Is she supposed to use obscenities every other word, say fuck and fuck this, cunt that the whole time? she really came along at a good time for all of us.
I am very impressed,
Barbara, that you are here today.
Jesus, you're kidding.
He wants you both to come, special invitation.
Completely retro,
I love that.
What a great idea.
I hope that you enjoyed your lunch.
Daviday, it was fantastic.
Now tell me, is there anything else
I can do for you?
You know what? You could wrap this up for me to take home.
It's for the dog.
We have a policy that we do not give food that was prepared for people to animals.
I'll give it to the dog.
No, that is the policy of the restaurant.
All right, Daviday, forget I said it.
Just wrap it up.
I'm taking it home. Okay?
We do not give doggy bags to dogs.
Why do you think they call it a goddamn doggy bag, huh?
If you want to feed an animal, why don't you go to Petco and get a bag of kibble?
Well, I give him kibble and I like to spice it up
You know what?
Yes.
We shall see. that you can't give a doggy bag to a dog.
You're excused.
Hey, Larry.
Long time no see.
What did you have for lunch?
Chicken and fruit go together.
You can have this for dessert.
I highly recommend it.
Mm, that time again, huh?
Good to see you, man.
I was just over at Cha Cha's.
Whew. Jesus.
Listen, I had an idea.
I want to go to a movie tomorrow night
Cha Cha and me and you and Cheryl.
What do you think?
I don't know. I mean,
I don't know what our plans are.
I'll let you know.
I'll call you.
What's wrong?
Yeah, and she loves you for it.
Me too, by the way.
Yeah, well, it's not really working out for me,
I gotta tell you.
Why not?
Her office is right across from the bathroom. stop and chat with her both before I go and after I go. It's too much.
She means well.
By the way, she's told me that you go to the bathroom, like, 10 to 14 times a day.
She was concerned.
Okay, do you see what I'm saying?
This is what I'm talking about. how often I go to the bathroom, what I'm doing in there, how long I'm in there.
Talking to you about my that's not good, all right?
No, I'd rather have a stranger, who I don't have to report into.
She has bowel concern for you and I do too.
I don't need her bowel concern.
Yeah, usually I have bottles of water. without drinking, like, thousands of gallons a week.
Okay, all right, let's stop talking about this.
My bathroom habits are not your concern, okay?
All right, I won't care about your health. Fine.
I'm in very good health.
Fine. You can put my colon up next to your colon.
We'll see who's got a cleaner, healthier colon.
I'll have a colon contest with you any time you want.
Any time you want to have a colon contest, buddy, yeah.
You're shitting and pissing almost 70 times a week.
Get the hell out of here.
This is ridiculous.
She's right next to you.
I don't want her monitoring my bathroom habits, okay?
What are you eating?
A lot of grains and fruit and nuts like a Jew squirrel?
You're not going to the bathroom again?
No, I'm not going to the bathroom.
I was trapped inside the stall and I'm telling you, it's killing me.
Let me just ask you a couple other questions.
Are you experiencing any dizziness?
Are you going to the bathroom a lot?
I don't see how that's am I going to the bathroom a lot.
Are you urinating a lot?
What does that have to do with my ear?
This is a standard
I know, but I really don't think it's relevant to how often I go to the bathroom.
With all due respect,
I think I'm the one who should tell you if it's relevant or not. And it is. move on. How about that?
What, you're not gonna tell me about your urination?
I'd really rather not talk about it.
I don't see how it's anybody's business, frankly, you know.
It's kind of private
How often I go to the bathroom is kind of a private thing. we're not on a bus. I'm a doctor.
We'll just have to make a diagnosis without this information.
I'm normal.
Let's just say that, okay?
Three times a day, four times a day?
If you had an office next to the bathroom and it was one of those days
I was drinking a lot of water, you'd say, Boy, this guy goes a lot.
I've been going more often than I normally would. to drink water.
That's a good thing.
Yes, sure sure.
Okay, let's move on.
Please.
How's your stool?
It's normal, okay?
Is it more than once a day?
Many times it is, yeah.
Who knows?
That's good. That's a good thing.
I'm exhausted from being here, you know, having to talk about my stool, how often I'm urinating.
I mean, you know, my ear hurts.
Okay, here's what I'm gonna just basically stay off it.
Use your left ear to talk on the phone
Don't use the phone from my right ear?
Yeah. I mean, you just want to limit the amount of noise that goes into it.
You want me to talk lefty?
Yeah, just talk lefty.
I have a hard time talking lefty on the phone.
Everything comes out wrong.
It's like throwing lefty. I can't do it.
I'm not myself. I feel different, strange, like I'm not me.

Okay, fine.

Okay?
All right.

Okay, what'd you do?
I slunk out.
You slunk out?

The guy could have killed me.
Next time a man calls you a fucking faggot, you get in that ass, Larry.
Know what I mean?
You get in that ass, Larry.
That's what the fuck you do.
You pull their asshole open, step into their asshole, close the door behind you,
Larry was here.
Then you open that asshole open it again, open that asshole
Step out of his ass and leave that motherfucker wide open,
That's how you handle people.
Mm.
Get in that ass, Larry.
I hope you don't get me killed.
Is this Larry?

He can't go down there.
You go, Larry.
You go tell him that you've been shitting all over yourself all day, shitting in your pants, you can't make it to the toilet, you got shit running down your leg.
Why can't I make it to the toilet?
Because it's more dramatic that way.
I don't wanna tell a guy
I got shit running down my leg.
All right, tell him whatever the fuck you want. Tell him you've been

Hello, Daviday.
Hello, Larry.
Nice to see you again.
Good to see you, Daviday.
You know,
I ate the leftovers and I just want you to know
I got sick from them.
Now when you say that you got sick, do you mean that the animal got sick or that you got sick?
Yes, and I'm just kind of wondering if the food perhaps was tampered with.
Well, it most certainly was not tampered with.
Are you sure?
I'm very sure.
Because I was sick.
I was running to the bathroom all day.
Aha.
Cha Cha?
Come here for a moment, please.

Hey, stay here for a second.
No no, I just want to see your handiwork.
Hold on.
Hey, don't go anywhere.
Larry?
Do you know how many millions of virgin trees are cut down to make this toilet paper, which is contributing to global warming, which is causing hurricanes, which is why you're here?
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about, Larry?
We use recycled in this bathroom? And why were you in this bathroom using this toilet paper?
Again, the toilet was broken,
We asked you?
Hold there, hold up.

I'd attack you right now. and hit on her and she doesn't respond and you fucking get her fired,
Who are you to tell him how many kids to have?
She's got nine kids.
Come on, that's plenty.
Who the fuck are you, the messiah, to count?
I got news for you.
That's enough. By the way, in China you're allowed two.
What happens if you have three?
Not the baby, idiot.
They kill the parents.
Get out of here.
Well, maybe they don't execute,
How dare you lose my girlfriend's job?

I was joking.
You heard what I said.
How do you wind up with a dog like that?
Mmm.
Good, do you know what? because after you left,

You've gotta admit that.
I pet that dog, yes.
Anyway, just do me a favor and tell her I was joking.
Well, I would, except I can't really call her.
The deaf thing again.
I know she's deaf.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
You want me to come by, make a special trip?

I would think that they wanna be treated like everybody else. cause they're the only ones
Every other kind of handicapped person you can apologize to on the phone.
Deaf people require that you go to their house.
Right.
I wouldn't think they would want that. That's all.
I still would appreciate it if you would come by and apologize to her.
She really loves that dog.
That dog sits in your lap while you're watching TV?

Okay, I'm more than happy to come by.

I'd love to go.
Well, you know, my wife could get better by tomorrow.
What? You get what?
What are you talking about?
No, that's crazy.
No, don't be silly.
I just overheard that you had an extra ticket, and I love Grease, and I'd love to go,
All right, okay.
We're gonna have a blast.
That's gonna be fun.
That's gonna be great.
Should I pick you up?
Sure, pick me up.
Hey, we're gonna have fun.
We'll get fucked up.
Yeah, I think I got it. I'm flipping ass right now. I'm out of control right now.
This toaster ain't worth a damn.
Man, that is banging, girl.
Perfect.
You know, even if one of you actually got a job, you could probably all just move into an apartment, huh?
What are you doing?
I thought you were coming later.
Later? I couldn't wait to see you.
I couldn't wait to get here.
Do I look good?
Do I look healthier?
Do I look relaxed?
You got a nice bounce to your step.
This girl maybe even loves me, and I am in love with her.
Dad, I'm thrilled
They like all their clients.
This is their job, to like their clients.
She outdid herself on this job.
You know what I want to do?
Come on, Larry.
She did things that say love.
Larry.
I'll be right down.
Yeah, Dad, you know,
But this one liked me particularly.
Larry.
Wheat toast?
You know what?
Honest to God, I gotta take Loretta to this job interview and that toaster takes a year.
This is what
I'm talking about.
I feel like eating for the first time in I don't know how long.
All right. Okay, all right,
I'll get you the wheat toast. Okay.
I got a lot of time invested in this toaster, Larry.
Now I'm gonna have to start over again.
Will you get a man his toast?
Okay, here you go.
I wanted toast.
This has been in the toaster.
Can you toast it again?
You can't pause toast.
Larry.
Dad, come on.
All right, great, let's go.
Loretta, I swear, I'm going as fast as I can. What can I do?
Do you like that one?
Okay, thanks.
I'll be right back.
Hi. I know I'm late, but I'm Loretta Black.
He had to leave.
Can we reschedule?
He's already filled the position. 15 whole minutes we were waiting on that damn toaster.
Yes. Because of that damned toaster,
I missed my job interview. a new toaster right now.
Will you stop it, please?
I am gonna get my love lady,
I am gonna get her a toaster.
You don't have to press down on it.
That's a good one, but do you think it's gonna take all day?
Well, you know, that's the question. you like that? from like albino to the heart of darkness Africa black.
I'll be right back.
Hi. Ahem.
Toaster?
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me.
I was joking about the dog.
Ha ha ha.
Joking, joking.
No, not a rat. No rat.
No no.
I like the dog.
You want me to kiss him?
Okay okay.
Yeah yeah.
Thank you.
That's bad.
Cocksucker, come on.
Misunderstanding.
Yeah, misunderstanding.
You'll be at the play?
Grease?
It's not that. but she's got a kind of way of looking at me
I love this thing and I know you are too.
You're not getting her a cappuccino machine, okay?
Listen, Dad. I set this massage up, okay?
She gives them to everybody.
It's a misunderstanding.
Anyway, I just wanna talk to you about it and tell you what's going on. on my cell phone.
Thanks, Hal.
All right. from Woodcrest Financial Services calling.
I'm not interested.
I've got an offer you are gonna love, though. This is a serious offer.
Nothing seems to register.
Wait wait wait. You have any idea what we're talking about here?
We're prepared to make you an offer.
I just called Leon Black to offer him that job.
What's going on, boy?
The fuck you talking about, man?
Look here, man.
Your lady came on to me.
I hit that ass and I moved on, dawg.
You wasn't in town, dawg.
Black man doin' his thing, baby.
Barack Obama, motherfucker.
Barack Obama, I'm the president,
I'm hitting that ass.
Look, that's not cool, man, all right?
Actually, it's kind of offensive.
Don't do it, okay?
Black man's doin' his motherfucking thing in the world, baby. okay? It's offensive.
I thought you were calling back to apologize about what you said to my wife.
You have your wife back, man.
I don't want the bitch no more.
I just said I hit it and I quit it, man.
Can't believe you, man.
I cannot fucking believe you.
Yeah, our phones got all mixed up, man.
You got my phone
I'm trying to call my boos, man.
Gonna use speed dial,

Anybody call me from Woodcrest Financial?
Guy named Hal call?
Mmm.
I'll get that.
Come all up in here.
Hey, Larry,
We're gonna see a production of Grease
Good. you found it okay?
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
I've been here before.
One of your neighbors had an infestation. a little late.
Have a good time.
This is Mike the exterminator.
That's my dad.
That's Lisa the masseuse.
How are you doing?
All excited.
Appreciate it.
Hey, Jean.
Yeah.
What? I didn't talk to Hal.
No talk to Hal.
Look her in the eye.
She knows.
Good apple.
Fuck you.
She talks?
What?
Good, you heard me.
You too.
What the hell did you do, sicko?
What does he get her all upset like that for?
Grease is about to begin.
Please turn off all cell phones.
Thank you.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
Look out, look out.
It's not a rat.
It's a dog.
It's a rat.
Well, yeah. feels good. It was fun.
Yeah, I would've liked to have seen it.
I was looking forward to it.
Me too, a lot.
If they happen to redo it,
I'll go if you want.
What are you gonna do?
All right.
Yeah, okay.
It's great.
Oh.
I don't feel well, honey.
Thank you, honey.
What are you doing?
No good?Cheryl is finally tired of Larry being Larry after her plane encounters severe turbulence and Larry seems more concerned about a malfunctioning TV device. After Cheryl announces that she's leaving Larry, the incident quickly splits up Larry's friends, who now have to break the news to Larry as to whose side they are taking.
You see? You see what's going on here?
See, look at that.
All right, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
He's not dead, he's back. He came back.
By the way, how come you didn't show up last Thursday?
It's probably the satellite,
You know, it just gets a little frustrating.
Every time I sit down and watch it, it's not working.
Honey, you couldn't call at a worse time. where the warranty card is
I'll come back later this afternoon,
You know what? Please.
He's gonna go.
I'm never gonna get him again.
It's all right.
I can come back.
No, stay right there.
Call me back in 10 minutes, okay?
Billy?
Have you ever seen horses like him?
Not quite.
Hey. Turned it off.
Guess what?
We're having dinner at Primo's tonight.
I made a reservation.
That's your husband.
Hey.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving, Larry.
I can't do this anymore.
You can't do this?
What?
What? What?
Does that really surprise you?
What do you mean you're leaving?
What are you doing?
I just called you from an airplane, telling you I was about to crash.
The TiVo guy was here.
I could barely hear what you were saying. He was about to leave.
I couldn't even get the guy to come to the house.
You know, it's very hard to get those people here. It was broken.
Barefoot Contessa,
Top Chef, Project Runway.
I wouldn't let him.
I saved those shows for you.
We've got these shows right here.
It's not just about the TiVo.
What? What else is it about?
What else is it about?
It's all of it.
You can't do anything like a normal person.
Who can't tell that real crab isn't fake crab?
By the way, people should be able to tell real crab from fake crab.
You've gotta be a moron if you can't tell the difference.
If I bring that up while we're having sex, that's a fun topic to discuss.
You know what the thing is, Larry?
People ask me all the time,
How do you stay with him?
And I always tell them, There's another side to Larry that you don't see.
And then I just realized today there's no other side.
After I thought
I was gonna die and you hung up on me,
I started talking to the guy next to me and I realized not everybody's like you.
There are normal people out there that have conversations.
Okay, this guy. Does he carry mints and a pen and tissues at all times like I do, huh?
Does he have mints?
How is his breath? underwear that doesn't have a fly.
You have to drop the underwear
I'm gonna be at my sister's.
What are you doing this for? What?
I love you. How could you do this?
What do you mean?
You weren't there for me when I needed you.
You're talking on an airplane phone.
Yeah, I didn't think
I was gonna like this.
Usually I don't like the skin. It's delicious.
I marinate it before I roast it.
Cheryl left me.
She's gone, she's out of the house.
She's with her sister.
She's not coming back.
You know, she was coming back on a plane, and there was a storm, and she called me from the plane.
And you know, I had the TiVo guy in the house.
So?
This guy, we keep exchanging calls.
What happened with Cheryl on the plane?
There was a lot of turbulence.
She was really frightened.
The TiVo guy was there.
The plane's going down,
She's gonna get over it, and it's all gonna be okay.
No, she's not gonna get over it, because she met a guy on the plane.
Guy sitting next to her.
I feel terrible. I'm emotionally distraught over this.
I mean, I know this would never happen to Nan and myself.
Okay, Cheryl's a great girl.
She's adorable, good cook, fun to be with.
She has a terrific body.
None of us at this table ever would have met Cheryl
Cheryl's a great girl, but we have to stick with Larry.
People are gonna take sides now.
Listen, this is a time we have to stand behind Larry.
Hey, that could be Cheryl.
You'll get it later. We don't answer the phone at dinner.
What kind of fucked up rule is that?
Give me that.
Give it to me.
We don't answer the phone during dinner. It's a rule.
I forgot to cancel my reservations at Primo's.
Thank you for calling Primo's.
May I ask why?
Well, if you must know, my wife left me.
Okay, Mr David, in the future, it would be nice just to get a little more notice
Sure I believe you.
Your wife left you. Okay.
I'm getting from your tone that you don't believe me.
You have to cancel.
I understand.
I'm just saying that it's our policy to get a little more notice.
Okay, in the future, if my wife leaves me,
I'll make sure she does it in the morning.
Have a great night.
Maxwells?
That's Simon's birthday party.
He's having it at Maxwells?
Big band, special guest.
Who goes all out for a birthday party?
Like, that's crazy.
I thought he was having this in his house. You know how expensive that is?
I loaned him $10,000 last month.
He needed it to give himself a birthday party at Maxwells.
I'm paying for this thing.
I need to talk to you.
I had to call Primo's
And the hostess asked me why I was canceling, and I told her it was because you left me.
You want me to call a stranger at a restaurant and talk to them about our marriage?
She's not really a stranger.
Iris, you know Iris.
You know the one.
She's got the long hair.
I know who you're talking about, but I really don't think
I want to call her and tell her that we're breaking up.
I mean, who would go to the lengths of saying that their wife split up with them
Don't think I would.
Yeah well, excuse me.
I gotta actually get this stuff.
Cheryl, don't go.
Come on.
Come on, just stay.
Don't, don't.
I need to go, Larry.
Will you call the restaurant? and I noticed the invitation to your party.
Aren't the invitations great?
I took a lot of time on that.
I had no idea the party was gonna be at Maxwells and the special guests.
Wait till you hear about the special guest. Yeah.
I loaned you $10,000 a month ago.
You didn't tell me you were having this big party for yourself. $10,000 has nothing to do with the party.
I'm not using that money for that.
No, have nothing to do with each other.
Simon, you're crazy, you know?
Cheryl is gonna be there.
Are you comfortable with that?
I'm comfortable.
You believe this guy? $10,000 I loan him.
Disinvites me from the party, choosing Cheryl.
I'm paying for that party.
You know that? Hey, Zev.
I gotta go back to Fluff and Fold now.
Alana didn't show up. You know,
Cheryl took care of all that stuff.
You're just lost, aren't you?
You know what I got in my foyer at home?
Pictures of all my dry cleaners.
Hey, Xena the Warrior Princess.
Yeah.
Oh.
How am I gonna get another picture?
Man.
You can get Lucy Lawless's picture, can't you?
You know what?
I'll get ahold of her agent and we'll find it.
I'll get it.
Okay, I'll get you another picture.
Could you have her make it out to Zev this time?
Just give me the picture.
Please take this couple
Thanks, have a nice dinner.
We're just really full tonight.
It should just be a couple more minutes.
Let me ask you a question.
Is that why I'm not getting a table?
Because you didn't believe my breakup story last night?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I make that up?
That's insane.
Mr David, we'll be right with you.
Primo's, this is Iris.
Sure, come right in.
We did break up. That's why
I had to cancel the reservation.
You totally deserve that.
You totally deserve it.
Yes, you do.
On no planet is a shoe caddy a good gift.
All right, yeah, no no no,
I get that
Who are you talking to?
What's the difference?
To the outside observer, it's the same level of annoyance.
Well, I need to talk to my friend.
I can barely hear here.
Okay, well, maybe if you talk lower to your friend,
He's still doing it.
Do you hear that?
Listen, you hear this?
He thinks he can just sit there and talk out loud and not be annoying.
Do you hear that? He's literally just doing it just to be annoying.
He's been driving me nuts the last 10 minutes.
Honestly, I'm done anyway.
This is bullshit.
No, he's still talking.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Let's play golf.
I can't. Larry, the Funkhousers have made a decision.
We're going with Cheryl.
Yeah.
Is Cheryl here?
What are you doing here?
I work for Mrs Cheryl.
This is Glenn.
This is Larry.
Nice head of hair.
Okay. What are you doing here?
You need to call
Okay, thanks. underwear business doing? 74 percents of the men we tested go over the fence.
The penis needs an option, just like everybody else.
It needs an option.
All right, well, you should probably get going.
Pen?
You know what?
I wouldn't care
I wouldn't care if she left me for a bald guy.
A guy who goes into a store and goes,
I need a pair of underwear.
Hello?
Hold on one second.
Really, thank him.
Thanks, bye.
Here you go.
Lucy Lawless.
I don't know.
I took one sip.
I not only get you the picture,
I get you Lucy Lawless.
To tell you the truth, I thought he was gonna be more bowled over by your presence.
He took it pretty calmly.
I used to be very intimidated by that warrior princess, I gotta tell you.
I actually think
I could take you.
Look, I'm not a cool guy or anything, okay?
I haven't been on a date in 12 years, but I would love to waste your time for couple of hours.
What do you think about that?
Can I do that?
Is that possible?
All right, yeah.
I do.
He is an asshole.
Really? You don't like him?
Bye.
What is that?
Call me?
I asked her for a date.
Here's what I said.
I'm not really a cool guy or anything, which is a pretty good line I thought.
I never did that when I was dating, admit that I wasn't a cool guy.
Now I didn't give a shit.
I just said, I'm not a cool guy.
It fucking worked. I'm not a cool guy.
I'm gonna use it all the time.
You're going with Cheryl, aren't you?
Yeah. Yeah.
You're bringing it tonight, man.
What, am I gonna sit home?
She's going out.
Xena the Warrior
Based on your signs and symptoms, when you twisted your body, your testicles got ensnared in the fly of your underwear, which acted like a noose.
It's a bruising, which will probably last about a week or so. switching to a style of underwear with no fly.
That's a popular brand.
You got long balls, Larry.
Long balls.
Doctor, you've seen his balls, right?
Would you say my balls were unusually long?
They're a bit more distended than the average testicles.
That's your new name.
Long balls.
Who the hell knew?
Long balls, change the drawers.
Okay, fine.
You know what, I got a date.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem for me, but thanks.
Thanks for the info.
All right.
My man.
I've actually trained my body not to use public toilets.
Yeah, I'm getting a red flag here, Larry.
You know what? We should switch sides.
Because the game's on.
Because I'm TiVoing it.
It's like a black man in Sweden.
Mr Akivo, your table's ready.
Okay, we were definitely here ahead of them.
Hey, Primo.
Mr David, good evening.
What's going on? All these people
I came in ahead of are getting seated.
How come I'm not getting a table?
Mr David, there is no table.
No table? How come?
What do you mean no table?
Can you believe that?
It's okay.
We could go to my house.
Your house?
What?
My testicles got ensnared in the fly of my underwear, and the doctor said
I can't have sex for a week.
But we can go there for dinner.
I was only talking about dinner, you big asshole.
No. No.
That's gotta be a mistake. I gotta be on this list. I'm a close friend.
If you're not on the list,
Hey.
What the heck are you doing here?
You're invited?
No, he didn't invite me.
I have a gig.
He's paying me 10 grand to do a set.
It's a piece of cake.
I'm paying for you.
You're my money.
I gave him $10,000.
This is not San Quentin.
I don't care.
You're not going in.
This is just business.
No, it's not business.
What are you doing?
I hit you in the thigh, you big baby.
I got long balls.
Lakers down by two with seconds remaining.
He drives up the lane.
Blocked, re
What is it?
Eh, don't worry.
Just come with me.
You did this for me?
You don't know how much
I appreciate this.
I really appreciate it.
I really appreciate it, Larry.
Thank you, Larry.
Larry, you're disgusting.
Ah.
Agh.
Auntie Rae.
I only have five seconds.
After that, it's out of my controI.
Not me. I've got discipline down there.
I have a very discerning penis. the appointment go? With the doctor?
I will no longer be snoring. from my snoring.
I wake up my dog.
My dog starts howling.
I'm out of controI.
Hey, guess what else? I think Ben Stiller's gonna come with me as a client.
And here's your sandwich.
You know what I'd love?
I'd love an Arnold Palmer.
Excuse me?
Can I give you a drink order?
Thank you.
Man, she's nice.
Yeah. Nice to people with hair, she's nice. discriminated against constantly.
Yeah, ask any bald person.
Ask, go ahead.
You still have issues with being bald. tomorrow and I found myself bald,
It'd be no big deaI. It's all naturaI.
Hey, they have a pharmacy here, right?
I'm gonna go now, drop it off, then I'll pick it up when I'm done.
BeautifuI.
Ah, let's take a look here.
Can I get that in the next half hour?
Sure. Yeah, we can do that.
Great, thank you.
I could have sworn when I left,
Excuse me. Hi,
I don't want to impinge on a friendship.
Impinge away.
Go ahead and impinge.
I took one.
Shoot me.
One. Two of them might have been stuck together.
Thank you.
Hi, Larry.
God damn, Larry.
What the fuck, man?
You hug my auntie, man, you stab her in the stomach?
What the fuck, I mean, what the fuck?
Loretta.
I can't controI it. I have no controI.
It's not my fault.
Just like that, you got turned on?
Not just like that.
That's a long time, five seconds.
You all over her. You stab her in the fuckin' stomach, man.
Believe me, it's not gonna happen again.
You better make sure it don't happen again, because we can go.
I guess that
I'm gonna go call her for a date right now.
Just a moment, please.
Actually I'm all booked up tonight, but I am available tomorrow
Speak to my receptionist to get the pertinent details. or in case of any emergency, just page me.
Okay.
Okay, will do.
Good, and I recommend being five minutes early.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
All right, Larry, thank you.
Okay.
Hi.
Yeah, come on in.
I'm her sister.
She'll be right down.
You have nothing to worry about, it'll be fine.
Yes, yeah.
Your brother and sister, they're staying with you?
Yeah, they're gonna be with me just a couple months.
Yeah.
I got a groin issue.
Did you ice it right away?
You never want to massage with muscle,
For instance, this is your groin.
Watch out for my testicles right over there.
Larry?
Why don't we move this to my bedroom?
Sure.
Go upstairs, take off your clothes, and I'll be in to see you in a few minutes.
Okay.
Larry?
Why don't you get dressed and I'll meet you in the foyer?
I'm telling you, Jeffrey, there's nothing like dating a doctor.
We talked for 45 minutes about my groin injury.
No no, she just wants me to massage it.
It's killing me too.
I'm gonna see you later. I'm gonna stop by before your operation.
Okay, man.
Okay, take care.
Oh.
Auntie Rae.
No no, it's not.
A doctor wrote me this note.
I can't make out a word of it.
You know the way they write.
They have terrible penmanship.
No no, Larry.
That's an S?
I thought that was a T?
Truck.
Do you have a truck?
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm at the hospitaI.
Yeah, I was moving a futon.
And I had to take the top
You can't believe what I just overheard in the bathroom.
What an unbelievable jerk.
This guy is on his cell phone, he's talking to his friend, and he's upset and he's complaining.
I hurt my hand because
I had to take the top because of this
What did you say?
What did you just say? in the English language.
How dare you?
You are despicable.
I can't stand people like you.
I have to face this kind of wretched foolishness.
Bald?
I wonder what's keeping Dr. Page?
Why hasn't this patient been prepped?
He is prepped, sir.
Excuse me, nurse.
Do I have to do everything myself?
I know what I'm doing here.
Clippers, please.
No no.
Look at me.
What the hell happened to you?
Dr. Page accidentally shaved
No, the procedure was cancelled.
Jeff.
Mr and Mrs Greene,
I was coming to see you in the operating room and I had just been victimized by a terrible incident in the cafeteria.
Do you know who this man was?
I have no idea who he was.
He was just a despicable bald man.
Did he, by any chance, wear glasses?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, he was wearing glasses.
And it was awfuI.
Sitter?
Sitting?
He described you. He said, Bald, glasses.
There's nothing wrong with being bald.
Yeah, in 40 years.
Not fucking today.
Because he knew it was never gonna happen.
That's right. You know what?
Curse on you.
Mine's gonna grow back, yours isn't. You deserve it.
What did you say to that doctor?
Here's what happened, okay?
Here's what happened.
I was in the cafeteria.
I'm in the stall, an unbelievable
He's talking on his cell phone to his friend.
I hurt my hand
Larry just said nigger.
Is that how you feeI about us?
That we a bunch of niggers up in here?
What is all this fussing and cussing going on up in here?
Larry D. done called us nigger.
First, you're rubbing all up against me, then whacking off in the damn car.
I'll come down there to whip your poor ass.
We ain't gonna put up with that.
Fuck you, Larry, wit' your monkey ass.
DaryI. Keysha.
Like how you do what you do.
It's a sexy ass, Susie.
Fuck you, Larry.
Peace.
I think that you're limiting yourself by just doing comedies.
Let's show people more.
Why can't you win an Academy Award?
The studios, they'll do anything you want to do. we just gotta push 'em in the right direction, man.
You sign with me, I will fight that fight to get you those roles, to develop those projects with you.
That's gonna fall in your lap.
I'll do the work. You won't notice anything different except for the fact that you're collecting awards.
Okay?
What?
Stiller said no.
Said it doesn't feeI right.
You know what doesn't feeI right about it?
Doesn't want a bald man to be representing him.
Hey. You know what?
I know exactly what I want.
I'll come back in a little bit.
That's the way it works, my friend.
Welcome to my world. and go over my bill.
Go over my bill. I'm gonna sue these motherfuckers.
This blows.
How do you deaI with it?
You just get used to it. And I get support from my bald brothers. but we see each other on the street, we nod.
You know what? We love each other, me and my bald brothers.
Still obsessed with that note, huh? 10 people.
Excuse me, could you do me a favor?
I can't read this. Could you make out any of that handwriting?
Take it to a pharmacist.
They're the only ones who can make out a doctor's handwriting.
Yeah, go.
Larry David. I dropped off a prescription the other day.
I'm going out with a doctor, and she wrote me this note,
I can't read it.
You're my only hope.
Larry, had a great time last night.
Would love to get together Friday night
I know you feeI the same way.
Tell me your life wouldn't be better without the Blacks.
It's your business.
They're black but their name is Black.
It's open.
Come on in.
Are you out of your mind?
Mm.
Thanks for driving me home.
I couldn't drive.
I feeI nauseous and like
And as far as what happened earlier,
I'm mean, you know,
Honest to God, that's all I need.
Why don't you just go?
Ugh.
One second.
Jeff's snore? Man, I'm telling you, that was awfuI.
Worse than the damn hurricane.
Talk to your boy, man. Shit, that motherfucker swallowed a kazoo.
Come on.
It's safe.
It's safe.
My own daughter locks herself in her room.
Won't come out whenever I'm home. loving people has turned into a witch.
A witch. 'Cause I'm bald, it's changed everything.
Ben Stiller won't work with me because I'm bald.
I mean, come on.
Do you know how many millions
I'm losing because of that?
Millions I'm losing.
All right, I don't know what else to say. Thank you.
All right, Mr Greene. I understand now we're going to hear from Mr Larry David, who will testify on Mr Greene's behalf.
Mr David?
Mr David, as you know, we are looking into allegations of physician misconduct stemming from the incident on the 17th of this month.
Would you please tell the board what happened?
I was having lunch in the cafeteria, and I excused myself to go to the bathroom. it's a thing we all do.
It's not a crime, right?
Go ahead.
Anyway, I went into the stall. when I use a public toilet, as opposed to the urinals.
I find there's, you know, there's no privacy, and if there's no dividers, it's kind of like going in a trough.
All right, all right.
Go ahead, please.
Please continue,
Mr David.
Go ahead, sir.
Please continue.
Mr David, is there a problem?
Please, tell us what the man on the cell phone said.
Mr David, tell us what the man said. how could you have lived with that maniac for that long?
Cause, you know,
I'm not that guy anymore.
Honestly, you don't look like that guy anymore.
Look, look how much
I've changed.
You look like a reaI person,
I used to walk around in sneakers
I have to say,
I love the new Larry.
I don't give a shit about golf anymore.
I just want to be with you.
And you know what else?
And I know you love scuba diving.
But whatever,
I'll feeI around for the fish, you know.
Well, it seems like you've done a lot of reflecting.
I'm a completely changed man.
The only vestige of my old self is that I've still got the good breath, you know.
That's the thing you're keeping?
The new Larry's keeping the minty breath, yeah.
The old Larry you're getting rid of?
He's over.
He's over.
He did?
You know what?
Forget that Larry.
He's dead.
He's dead.
He's completely dead.
Anyway, it's really good to see you.
It is good to see you too.
It's very impressive that you're
Hey, let's go to the movies movies, dinner.
Really?
Let me just talk to my therapist and see what she has to say first.
I just want to make sure she feels good
I'll call my therapist and see what she says and I'll call you.
Great.
Hey, how much are we supposed to tip the bartender, by the way?
Don't they make too much money?
I mean, everybody buys a drink.
They get, what, 20 percents of every drink?
That's insane, isn't it?
Well, they work really hard.
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's good.
They work hard, you know.
It could not have gone better.
It was amazing. you know,
I was tucked in,
I had shoes on.
She never likes the way I dress, but she noticed and she was very impressed with that.
I looked like a man, you know.
This is great stuff.
It's great progress. because I'd like to think
I know what I'm doing.
I was talking about the future if we get back together,
I want to traveI with her, you know, on bicycles. wouldn't I go, but, you know what?
I would do it with her. I really would.
Be enthusiastic, but don't make any specific promises that you can't fulfill.
Geez, I said a lot of stuff last night.
Again, let's focus on the next stage.
I asked her to go to the movies tonight, okay?
I love you.
Really?
At that point she's feeling vulnerable. that's when you have to up the stakes.
That's when you have to tell her you want her to move back in with you and she has untiI Monday to decide, or that's it.
It works.
That's all I can say.
Wow.
Wow.
She might not like it at first, but there's one thing she won't be able to say, is that the guy who just said that is a pussy.
No one likes a pussy.
What, you're getting a lot of pussy from me?
Not an amount that is not manageable.
That's why we have to say,
Monday is
Either we're back on, move back in,
Okay okay.
I think I got it.
Although I gotta say, being a pussy really wasn't my problem with her.
Huh.
We have to stop. go get 'em.
Okay.
Je t'aime.
I love you.
I gotta tell ya, the new Larry is really working for me.
The new Larry can really make you happy.
I really can.
I know I can.
Just the idea of you wanting me to be happy is amazing.
Not just happy, but really, like, delirious.
Is this what I think it is?
This is one great picture.
I love it.
It's good to see you guys.
Hey, can I ask you for a quick favor?
Really?
Oh. at Venice beach.
Yeah, sure. 250 bucks.
Larry David, right there.
It's worth it, believe me.
You don't know what Alzheimer's is.
What does he do?
He runs around the house all day naked, chasing himself, playing tag.
He screams at the cat cause she didn't vote.
Wow.
Every time he farts, he calls the fire department.
Just sign it, please.
Don't make me beg you.
It is a great cause.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
It's good to see you guys.
Thanks.
Come on, what is it? $250?
I feeI like you are a different person.
Honey, I am a different person.
I want you to move back in with me.
You have till Monday to decide.
Monday?
Yeah, Monday.
Then the offer's off the table.
You're giving me an ultimatum?
No.
Hey, CheryI.
CheryI.
CheryI, the therapist told me to say that.
You know what, Larry?
I thought the new Larry didn't lie.
The therapist said that.
He gave me the deadline.
I was actually believing you.
No, believe me.
That was all true, except for the deadline part.
The therapist told me to say that.
CheryI.
Agh. Agh.
Oh.
You ruined my life.
You ruined my life, okay?
She's gone.
It's a setback.
It's a setback.
I told you she wasn't bothered by the high pussy percentage,
You know what we're going to do now?
We're going to go to her house and you're going to tell her that the whole thing was your idea.
Okay, let's have a session.
No, I don't want to have a session.
You're going to tell her that you told me to give her that stupid ultimatum.
It won't take long.
I guess so.
Come on in.
Thanks.
Wow.
You're on the ocean?
Yeah.
And I decided, you know what?
I've always wanted to live on the beach.
Mm.
I told Larry to give you an ultimatum.
He told me to say that.
You told him to say that?
Yeah, because the picture that was painted of you was not the person
What does that mean?
I don't know. it means nothing. you were the kind of person who would like an ultimatum. loving portrayaI.
What have I been saying about her?
That's why I'm just saying, whoo.
I'm just impressed.
Why would it matter what
The face tells a story.
All right, all right.
Fine, okay.
Now I know that.
I'm 90 percents to blame for everything. 90 percents? I think 100 percents. 100 percents to blame.
Well, I'm taking the lion's share.
No, take more than the lion's share.
Take the whole share.
Take it all.
Okay, all right.
No, that's fair.
Yeah, I'm 100 percents to blame.
I told Larry to hold your hand, to say, I love you.
The new Larry is you?
What?
What did you say?
You're not responsible for the new Larry. the new Larry.
You told me to take 100 percents.
I invented the new Larry, not you.
What about tucking in the Tshirt? you told me to tuck in?
All right, I understand what you're saying.
All right.
Okay.
All right, thanks for coming,
I guess.
Why are you taking credit for new Larry?
I laid the foundation for new Larry. you laid foundation.
You're a moron. How could you suggest such a thing?
It's not an exact science.
I mean, that is unbelievable, seriously.
But the therapist doesn't know anything about me.
If the therapist thought
I was a terrific guy,
How do you get to her?
I got it.
Let's go.
Then I come out of nowhere,
I tackle you, take you down, get the purse from you.
You run off, you get yourself a cup of coffee, a piece of pizza.
And I return the handbag and I'm like a god, you know.
Pshh, I'll do that shit.
You're my motherfucking man,
Larry.
Is he the greatest?
Are you the greatest, man?
That's how we fucking do it.
I walk by,
I grab the fucking purse.
I run down the street,
Larry pops the fuck out, tackles me, tries to get the purse back.
I fuck Larry up,
When you tackle me I ain't going to look like a fucking bitch and shit, and then you run away.
You run away.
The more fucked up you are, the more of a hero you're gonna look like.
Leon, I don't need to look like that much of a hero.
Just stopping you and giving her her purse back's enough.
There's no way in hell.
It's not realistic, Larry, if I don't fuck you up.
That's my therapist
I was telling you about.
Nothing.
Nothing really.
What's happening?
What's happening, Leon?
It's all for fun.
I know you're not going along with that.
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.
He's not doing it.
You know what? got you into it.
Have him get your ass out of it.
She's right.
I'll do it.
Eh, fuck it.
There's her therapist.
Okay okay, that's her.
You see her?
Yeah, okay.
All right, let's go.
What are you doing?
What is this?
You look like a rapist with that thing on. You don't need that.
You know what?
Put the hood up.
Isn't that a cliche?
All right, good.
What?
I've changed my mind.
I can't do it. I can't do it.
Go do it.
I got it.
Here you are.
Thank you.
That was amazing.
You came out of nowhere.
Yeah, we're we're okay.
Do what you have to do. how did you do that?
What was I going to do?
I can't believe what I just witnessed.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Well, you're welcome.
You take good care of yourself, okay?
Thank you.
I'm a little shaken.
Wait, I never even asked your name.
Larry David.
Larry David?
Very funny.
Spread your legs.
That was amazing.
I mean, the way you swept in that didn't seem reaI.
It was reaI.
I can tell you that.
I'm still a little shaky,
I guess.
But you were just like
Clint Eastwood.
I have never seen anything that brave.
Eh, please, really.
I didn't even think twice about it.
The only thing I did think about for a second was my glasses, safety of my glasses.
Cause these are irreplaceable.
My wife left me
I'm not going to bother you with all this, you know.
That's all right.
Please.
But I feeI like she never really had any idea who I was.
All this time, all these years,
I really hid the reaI me, the me who saves people.
And, you know, I have been doing that most of my life.
Why would you?
No, I wouldn't.
All right, well,
I gotta go.
You are such a good person.
Do you know that?
Yes.
Yes.
I'd better get going.
You take care of yourself.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Well, I'm in prison.
Yeah. Jesus.
My feet stick out through the fucking bars.
I'm not even that tall, and my fucking feet stick out.
You're 5'10?
Stand up. Let me see.
Well, a hairsbreadth under.
You're cheating a little bit.
I don't think you're 5'10. that's not the point.
The point is
They become your friend for life.
He doesn't speak English.
Okay, all right.
I'm pretty optimistic.
And you know what?
Thank you. 'Cause you were there at its inception.
You pushed it through.
I'm very happy for you, but it's not top of the list of my priorities right now.
We're going to get you out of here.
Don't worry about it.
Do we have a time frame?
Please, let's aim for 24.
You got a deck of cards?
What can you do here?
I don't have a deck of cards, but yes,
I should have brought a deck of cards.
Damn it. It's always good to have a deck of cards, no matter where you are.
What are you talking about?
Just get me out of fucking prison.
I'm not talking about cards.
We have more time.
CheryI's getting out of her therapy appointment and I really need to talk to her.
I've not spoken to anyone normaI in 24 hours and I'm scared.
We have to stop.
How did your session go today?
Larry, I've spoken to my therapist and she told me I shouldn't ever be speaking to you again.
She said that?
Larry, really.
Are you kidding?
I should go. I should go.
Goodbye, Larry.
Hey, CheryI.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
CheryI called me up, told me that her therapist urged her never to see me again.
What?
She likes me.
Her therapist likes me.
That's why she told CheryI not to see me.
She wants me for herself.
What am I going to do?
If I reject her, she'll say bad things about me to CheryI.
I've got to get out of this.
What am I going to do?
I think you're fucked.
That's what I think.
Tommy.
What is he doing here?
He's supposed to be walking.
He's having a cup of coffee?
I'll see you later.
Hey. you doing, paI?
Where's your shirt?
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be walking.
I raised money.
I don't walk.
You didn't tell me you were sitting.
I wouldn't have given you money in the first place.
Why do you want me to walk?
Alzheimer's?
You were diagnosed with Alzheimer's?
I haven't told anybody.
You're the only one who knows.
I mean, it's not early.
What's that called?
I don't know if there's a term for that.
After we met and connected,
In three to five years
I'll be a vegetable.
Listen, you helped me the other day and I want to help you.
I forgot your name.
Well, you never know.
Let's order.
I'm getting hungry.
Yeah, you had the chicken salad.
I'm detective Kennan,
I talked to your assistant.
She told me I could find you here with Mr David.
Now I understand you didn't get a look at the guy, but that you did.
We actually have the guy already.
Aw, Jeez.
There he is.
There's my guy.
Hey ya, Bright.
Hey ya, Bright boy.
Huh?
What's the matter?
You seem a little down.
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.
I'm going out with CheryI tonight.
I've got a date with CheryI.
Come on.
I'm pretty excited, Bright.
I think it's going to work out.
You did it.
There you go, big winner.
Thank you.
And you come highly recommended.
I want you to move back in with me.
You have till Monday to decide.
Okay.
Hello?
He's just moping around?
I mean, we all are really worried about him, man.
This Cheryl thing's got him crazy.
This Cheryl thing's got him twisted, man, for real.
He's up there moping, man.
Mopy Dick, that's what he is.
Moby Dick is the book by Melville.
Mopy Dick, man.
His dick is moping.
Okay, let's go up and get his
You know what I mean?
You're straightforward. I like that shit.
What?
Come on, man.
You were busy with the TiVo guy.
Busy with the TiVo guy.
Yeah, I was busy with the TiVo guy.
Your brain is all fucking discombobulated, man.
I'm just never gonna meet anybody like her again, ever ever.
I can't even imagine being with anybody else.
Listen, man, you've got to get out there and do stuff.
Get down there and get breakfast.
What are you doing?
Is she going to Sammie's bat mitzvah?
Yeah, she's coming to the bat mitzvah.
She's bringing that guy too.
What do you want me to do?
We didn't pick sides.
I can't believe I've got to see her with this guy
Who am I gonna bring?
You're not gonna find her here, lying like this. Come on.
You're not comfortable in your Larry shell right now.
You've got to become another motherfucker right now.
Larry, grow a mustache, man.
Grow a goatee, a mustache, grow sideburns.
Become another motherfucker, man.
It's not bad advice.
But anything to get your ass out of bed.
You've got bedbugs?
Hey, I'll get him up.
Come on downstairs, man. The family wants to talk to you a little bit.
Look who I found.
You know what?
My mind is made up.
What do you want to talk to me about?
Yeah yeah.
The lady called today.
I am speechless.
I've got a little boo down there
I'ma holla at.
I know it looked like we weren't gonna ever get out of here, though,
You can always come visit now.
Eh, let's not go crazy.
Well, come on.
Let's go find it.
There's a gerbil running amok in my house. Come on, help me find it.
Okay, thank you.
I don't want anybody moving in across the hall.
You know, we have privacy here.
I know. Larry, there's nothing I can do.
We're not gonna have control of the thermostat.
Why don't we take that office then?
I'm not gonna pay for an office
I'm not using.
That's what
I want to know.
How are you?
Yeah, I feel better.
I'm feeling like I'm ready, but I hate being single.
I just hate it.
Am I?
Matt Tessler called and said,
Hey, I'm in the building.
I thought I'd drop by.
He said he knows you,
Seinfeld days.
Yeah, he directed four Seinfelds.
He was terrible, though.
He was a terrible director.
I don't know.
I could say that you had to leave,
Hey, Matt, what's going on?
Nice to see you. How are you?
I'm kind of stuck
Well, I did the cancer scare episode of Home Improvement,
Now they want me to do all the teardrop stuff.
I want to get back to the funny, to the shtoomy.
Cause they're floating my name to direct his pilot and I just would love to be in on that.
Well, if I run into him,
I'll recommend you.
Hey, Larry, do you still have that tickle in your anus?
I cannot get you an appointment for two weeks.
What?
Are you experiencing discomfort?
What are you talking about?
Who were you trying to get an appointment with?
I've got a better one.
Pencil.
Dr. Jay Whitney. she runs the office. and not just the back one, you know what I mean?
Seriously, she can get you in today.
It's nice of you, but there's really nothing wrong.
Why did you say
I have a tickle in my anus?
Are you fucking crazy, huh?
A tickle in my anus?
I don't have a tickle.
Who said that?
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Look, I think I've given you the wrong impression.
All I'm saying is, don't take any chances here, okay?
Hi, it's Richard.
Leave a message.
Hey, Richard, it's Larry.
All right,
I'll talk to you later.
Just sign in, please, and have a seat.
Shouldn't be too long.
I have a little problem you know.
My name's right out in the open here.
It's a bit of a privacy issue.
There's no shame in having to come to the gastroenterologist's office.
It's a little embarrassing maybe, you know.
We could just put a sign up on the wall saying,
Larry David was here.
Why don't we do that?
You know,
I have to tell you
I've worked here for four years and I've never had anyone come in and, like, cruise the list of patient names for any reason.
You keep that.
I don't like that.
First of all,
Second of all,
I can't even make decisions.
You have to take it up with the home office.
I would like to take it up with the home office. See, you didn't think
I'm not an inventor, but I'm an improver.
I improve things that are broken.
This is broken.
This system is broken.
I'd like to improve it.
What would you do if I sat there, huh?
You'd be a little freaked out if I sat there, wouldn't you, honestly?
Yeah, that's a little creepy.
What are you reading?
It is called
Showbiz Insider.
Many are called.
Few are chosen.
You must be very very bright.
Yes.
Where are you from,
New York?
Yeah.
You from New York?
Yeah.
But I'm not a Jew, if that's what you're thinking.
Cause I saw your wheels spinning.
That's uncanny. It's like there's a window into my soul and you can just really read me.
I read you loud and clear, sister.
I'm fine.
Checkup.
Hmm, really?
You? did you ever go out with a bald guy?
It was magical.
Well, they have called for me.
Larry?
I guess I'll go in for my checkup.
Hello, Mr David.
I'd just as soon tell the doctor.
I know, but if the doctor's gonna come in here, why not just tell the doctor?
I don't see why then you have to tell the doctor.
I'm going to New York.
Why am I stopping off in Florida? the information down first and I give it to him.
He won't have to go through all of the questions again.
The doctor should be in here right now.
We could be saving time.
He's gonna get the information and then what, run to the internet to look it up? No.
I just need the information.
I'm not that comfortable telling you, frankly.
I need to take it down before I can leave.
Okay, I have a gerbil up my ass.
That's my problem.
How long has it been there?
Two days.
Okay, thank you.
The doctor will be right with you.
Fine.
Happy?
It's private, just like you wanted.
No no no,
I don't want that.
You're listening to me?
I don't know what I'm talking about. back on.
You can't see this now.
I want to apologize for the way
I behaved earlier.
Mr David, you don't have to play games with me.
Are you looking for Christopher?
No.
Paula?
Aha.
I'm gonna take her to the movies maybe.
That's great.
The question is, what kind of doctor was that again?
Why was she there?
I don't know.
I hope she doesn't have the same thing I do.
Well, that's a good thing.
It'll go away.
Yeah.
Let me ask you
How much will you give me to start gargling now?
Mmm.
Just do it.
What, you don't trust me?
Here you go.
I would have paid that happily.
Tessler's still one of your clients?
Yeah. He's coming to the bat mitzvah.
You know who else is coming to the bat mitzvah?
My newest client
He's a huge RandB singer.
I have no idea who this guy is.
When was the last time
Anyhow, he's my client now.
He's coming to the bat mitzvah.
He's gonna sing.
Well, maybe I'll bring this woman.
You know, if we get along tonight,
I'm gonna ask her.
Cheryl's coming with that guy.
Why don't we
You know what? Susie and I were talking about going to the movies.
You're kidding.
Let's do it.
Perfect.
I can check her out.
I haven't dated in a while.
Who pays?
What do I do? Am I allowed
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Hi.
One movie.
Thank you.
Center? Why? You think there's a big difference
As long as a giant man doesn't sit
This guy.
He was faking.
That's really good.
I gotta take my hat off to him.
I gotta tell ya, that's pretty good.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why? Why are you asking me that?
No reason.
Everything okay with you?
Yeah, fine.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Why shouldn't it be?
It's just you're squirming a lot.
You're squirming more than I am.
Well, my seat is uncomfortable.
Yeah, my seat's uncomfortable too.
I know.
We're in agreement.
Why did you say you went to that gastroenterologist's again? of anybody going to a gastroenterologist for a checkup.
That's what you were doing there.
Honestly, I'm just really kind of bored with this movie.
I really want to go.
Can we go?
Please.
Are you gonna drag me out of this movie with five minutes to go?
That's insane.
It's not five minutes.
This is the world's worst film
I've ever seen and I really want to go.
Come on, five more minutes.
What do you gain by staying?
You don't care about this story.
I finish things I start. 500 pages, once I start them, even if I hate it, I'll finish it.
I have friends who I can't stand, you know, for, like, 25 years.
I'm still friends with them.
Why?
Because I stay to the end, till they're dead.
I go down with the ship.
That's what I do.
I'm not even the captain,
I'm going down with the ship.
That's how I want you
I'm the guy who keeps the captain company.
I can't watch this.
Excuse me.
I know.
I told her.
It's five minutes to go.
It's crazy.
Fine.
I timed it. There were six minutes left in that movie.
Irrelevant, Larry.
She was not gonna wait for you.
I invested an hour and a half.
Yeah, well, she has a tickle in her anus anyway.
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's go.
You know what?
That movie stunk, by the way.
No, it was great.
Eh, I don't want to go by myself.
She's a belly dancer.
Yeah, that's the one with the nose rings, right?
We'll just cover it with makeup.
Blech.
Do you want any coffee?
I'm gonna go get coffee.
No, I don't want anything.
This way. This is the one I was telling you that I think is just perfect.
I've got to take this.
Will you excuse me for one second?
Hello.
That's very good.
We'll be friends.
Well, you know,
No, I'm not. I have nothing to do here.
I've got to find the office manager.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Bye.
I hope you rent the office.
No.
I just came by to say thanks for the recommendation.
I got the gig.
What's this about?
Is this supposed to be funny?
This is how you welcome him?
No no no, it was a test to see if he's a tolerant person.
And anyone who's not is no neighbor of mine.
This is what you do?
You sit on your ass
I'm really disappointed in you.
I would rent an office to your son.
Hey, you know what's really funny? who puts gerbils up his ass for fun.
And you know what? I think a lot of people would get a kick out of this.
I really do.
Fuck you, Larry.
Let's just try it out on the street.
Do we still have time to do it? and it's too late for my career and you fucked me with Tessler.
He should be selling fabrics.
When I called you
I put quotes around it.
Why'd you recommend him,
Mr Quotehead?
I thought that you would pick up that it was a nonrecommend recommend.
You know, life is very brief, okay?
And you know I need a good series. because of your recommendation.
You call him
Ben Laden or Bin Laden?
I don't know.
You called him Ben.
That's almost like a Jewish name.
That's true.
Let's go to Ben Laden's.
They got great collars.
Exactly, yeah.
It's true, isn't it?
Did you stick a gerbil up your ass?
It's all over the set.
It's all over the fucking city now.
It's gonna be on the internet too.
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.
Jesus Christ, did you see the way that guy looked at me?
I'm sure he probably read Gerbil magazine and you're fucking on the cover.
Holy shit.
Hi, Carol.
Think about it.
Look, the gerbil's missing, right?
And then you hear this shit's going on. Come on now.
Add this shit up.
Add this shit up.
Here he comes now. What's going on?
What's going on, Larry?
The gerbil got on the elevator, hit up and went up your asshole?
I can't believe that this thing has already gotten to this house,
Are you saying you didn't do that?
Come on, that's insane.
That's what I thought.
Wow, this is really happening, isn't it?
Can you believe it?
You're gonna miss us, Larry.
We're gonna miss you too, Larry.
All right, don't get my waterworks going here.
We're gonna miss you, Larry.
That's deep.
Yeah. All right, I've got to get ready for a bat mitzvah.
You don't wanna go with me, do you?
Sure, I'll go
You saw the early rehearsals.
When you left
The network stormed out.
How in the fuck could my best friend recommend such an asshole? would have picked up on what I was trying to say.
Yeah, you are abnormal.
You're the most abnormal, jerky nutcase
On behalf of my wonderful wife Susie and myself
I want to welcome you.
It means a lot to us, a lot to Sammie,
I can tell you that.
We're very proud of her.
Come on up.
You know,
I've known Sammie since she was born, actually.
I was in the hospital that day and I saw her when she was, like, five minutes old.
It was not a pretty sight for me.
Okay? I'm sure you've heard it.
And there's not a word of truth to it, okay?
It's not true.
However, in the interest of full disclosure
I will tell you that, um,
I do have a tickle in my anus.
And they're slightly related to each other.
What did he say?
The point is, it's not true.
I just thought it was
What are you looking at,
Tessler?
I'll put a fist up your ass.
How about that, huh?
I'll be right back.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This one goes out to Sammie.
Would you care to dance?
Thank you.
Wake up, wake up.
Get the ball, Daryl.
What, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Get out of here.
Come on.
Stop playing. Stop playing.
It's mine.
Bullshit, motherfucker.
Don't nobody talk to my man like that.
You'd better get your ass out of my house,
Get your smile on.
Get your smile on.
Get your smile on, come on.
Am I smiling?
Here we go.Larry attempts a preemptive breakup with an ailing Loretta, and learns with Jeff that you can't make an empty gesture to a Funkhouser.

Finally.
Thank you.
You're welcome. the whole salt shaker up in here.
No, that's way too salty. way too salty.
Pfft, could you make it any hotter in here, by the way?
Black people like it a little bit warmer at night, okay?
I'll call leon. let's see what he says. leon. that's how we like it.
Okay, you know, i can't sleep. it's too hot at night.
I want to sleep in 68? temperature.
All right now, you make sure you do your homework before you watch that tv. don't erase them.
They erase all my tivo'd shows.
You know what, larry? there's been another robbery in this neighborhood.
I was just talking to the neighbors. it's the third one this month.
What are you talking to the neighbors for?
They came over and let me know what's going on.
You don't need to talk to the neighbors, okay?
Yeah, but, larry, there's been a robbery.
I'd rather have the thieves than what are you talking about? the neighbors want your time.
The thieves want your things. i'd rather give them things than time.
Listen, have you heard anything from the doctor about loretta's biopsy?
But no matter what the outcome is, loretta has you by her side.
You know, things could get bad, larry, but she's got you to hold her hand.
And if she has to do chemo and it causes her to lose her hair,
Throw up and all that, you gonna be right there by her side.
Thank you, larry. in that room at night.
It's like i'm cinderella in there, i swear to you. cinderella? what do you mean? cinderella, you never saw the fairy tale cinderella?
That's what it's like. exactly. we're waiting for the results.
I got about 24 hours to get out of this thing before the results come back.
The whole family's gotta
I'd much rather be in her position than mine any day of the week. you're in control.
Couples should have like a prebreakup agreement
All you do is send a text. if you see the word 'apricot, it means it's over.
Okay, hypothetically, what if you or she are eating apricots at that point?
You know, one in 30 is a good one.
Hey, how's it going?
Want to come to a dinner party tonight?
You know you love my cooking.
It's a little late for an invitation, is it not?
It's just not done.
I don't know the derivation of the convention.
Why are you following it blindly like this?
You should be glad that it happens that way, because if I told people you were coming, they might not show up.
I don't think that's why. It's just not done.
What's the downside of telling me?
Why do you even get started with her on this stuff? That's my question.
You'd better go do it.
Not now, maybe tonight.
You're welcome.
It's not fun. Think about it, you know?
I'm outside, i gotta go home and feed fish?
I mean, seriously, who gives a shit?
Mr david, i wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend.
You know, they're not pets, really.
But yet it's the same responsibility as a pet.
But you get nothing back. you watch them.
Is that supposed to be fascinating?
I don't know.
Think she has cancer? about that right now.
We did a biopsy
Say you had to make a bet with vegas on this,
What is this thing?
I've had this a while.
What is that?
It's just a skin tag. Just put a little lotion on there.
I'm gonna write you a few prescriptions to fill out.
I'm gonna prescribe zithromax and tylenol with codeine.
Now the tylenol, that's just as needed for pain.
You just go into the refrigerator without asking?
I was just surprised you didn't ask.
I'm surprised you didn't offer, to be honest.
You were not going to offer me lemonade.
It is difficult to be a fish owner.
Why is that a priority?
Your girlfriend is sick.
You do not need to think about that.
What you need to think about is the sick woman upstairs.
I'm thinking about that. And by the way, why couldn't you ask?
May I please have a glass of water?
I'm not the one that has a problem here. You are, my friend.
He goes in my refrigerator.
Come on, you don't do that. liquids are okay.
I don't believe that people should go into my refrigerator.
I don't go into other people's refrigerators. you're a welcome guest.
Hey, how's your sister, by the way?
Thanks for asking. she's doing a lot better.
Yeah. i'm really glad we took her out of that mental institution
You know, if there's
You let me know.
Look at her shoes before she calls your name.
Don't look at her in the eyes.
I don't know how you take a statement like that seriously.
But you said it and you're gonna stick to it.
I'll see you at jeff's tonight.
Dinner party.
I guess i wasn't invited.
I can't believe that.
Who was coming to the party, i would have known
To find out who's going to a party.
All i want you to do is entertain my sister for two hours
And then you can goto your godd.
I gotta sit in a room with that nut?
Thank you.
Thank you, jeff.
And i appreciate the effort, larry.
Guess who told marty to shut up. why, what did he say? a great actress.
You know who i mean. she's an actress.
Yeah, you do.
You had sex with a mental patient.
If i went over to the institution and fucked her, then she's a mental patient.
What happened? i got up to go to the bathroom.
I was sitting there and she said, i'm bored.
I said, if there's and then i'm off banging her.
You can't make an empty gesture to a funkhouser.
They take you up on it.
How come you don't have a doorbell?
If you had told me who was coming to the party in the first place,
I never would have said anything to him because i would have known he wasn't coming. you can't tell who you're inviting,
You can't tell anybody you're going
And you can't talk about it after.
Now i'm screwed. just look at this. this is crazy. what's he doing here?
How about if i said i'm pleasantly surprised? fine, we disagree.
Unbelievable.
What did you do with bam bam?
I've never seen her spirits like this.
That is fantastic. What great news.
No wonder she was singing
I love the fat boy.
It's great.
I can't thank you guys enough.
The key to the whole thing? You treat them normal and they really respond.
Dinner is served.
What is that? What do you mean?
Larry likes to clean out fridges like he did today at Marty's house.
You were into our fridge uninvited, right?
She's emotionally unstable. Are you gonna believe a word this woman says?
You know, I don't mind if you take liquid, but when you take regular food,
Speak the truth. Help him with the truth, would you, Jeff?
I wouldn't know. I actually wasn't there in the kitchen.
What did you say? What the fuck is she talking about Jeff? What the hell did you do?
Did you take advantage of this poor deranged girl?
You are sick.
That's disgusting.
What did you do now? You sick fucking pervert.
What did you do to her, Jeffrey?
All right, all right, all right. I believe you.
Even Bam Bam is not crazy enough to sleep with you, okay?
Only I am.
There you go.
Okay, everybody, everybody,
I'm going to have to take her back to the institution. think it would be good for her.
And you're doing it for her own safety, for her own good.
It's a great thing, because you've gotta think of the long haul.
Let's enjoy our dinner.
Hello?
All right, I'll go pick it up. No, I'll leave right now.
I have to go. I have to pick up Loretta's medication.
You're leaving, I haven't served the entree yet.
Go go go.
I got the prescription, Auntie Rae.
No. I don't want her talking. I want her resting.
Resting? What does resting even mean?
She's not sleeping, is she? You can talk and rest.
Larry, I am not gonna bother Loretta with this bullshit. Do you hear me?
I have a reservation? Let me see.
Larry David, 2.
My God.
Thank you.
Well well.
Hi, hello.
Larry.
My man. How's it going, brother?
All right. What, are you using my name to get a table in here?
You want to join us?
You sure?
I put you up for an
Yeah?
Fingers crossed, baby.
Yeah?
It didn't work out.
This is insane. How do they expect people to read this menu?
Larry, what you putting on your hair? I like that.
Posner.
You learning, Larry.
That's very good here.
I can't believe I'm sitting here with you.
Isn't it?
I really miss you.
I miss you too. kind of.
I mean, I do, I do. It's just what was happening was not working for me.
And then you'd come home And it was like that was the right amount of Larry.
I understand. Too much Larry, I get that.
We can reduce Larry in half.
We can reduce Larry to a third. We can reduce Larry to three hours a day.
He's on his way over to the house right now. He's got the results of the biopsy.
He's coming over to the house right now?
I'm on my way.
Shit, damn it.
Larry.
Never mind. Apology accepted. Now call Marty.
Just tell me, you lied, right?
You lied, Jeff enjoyed.
Don't look at them, Larry.
Don't get eye contact.
Go. Go. Go.
Get your cell out.
Bammer, what are you doing here?
Tell him Jeff said I was in the top 10.
Tell Marty Jeff enjoyed me.
You should not have left the house.
Folks, we had a report of a
Okay, she'll give you a statement.
I've gotta get in the house.
I'll take your statement now.
No, she can't give you a statement.
She's not qualified to make a statement.
Yeah, after what she said at dinner tonight, she's crazy.
I'm taking her back.
If she can't give one, I'll need a statement from you. Have a good night.
Sir, did you see a vehicle? Was it individuals
What happened? What exactly did you see?
Sir, your attention here, sir, if you would, please.
Folks, I wish that I had better news for you.
The biopsy came back positive for cancer.
Come on, Larry, come on.
Okay, all right.
I know this can be very upsetting.
It's gonna be okay.
This is really where the hard work starts.
She's gonna need a lot of help. There's a lot of vitamins, a lot of medicines that she's gonna need. Organic juices three times a day.
I would keep the house warmer.
Keep it at about 78? to 82? minimum.
The warmer the better, really.
That helps with the healing process.
I know this is a lot to take in, but if you guys work hard, especially you, in two, three, maybe four years, she's hopefully gonna be fine.
And your life is mostly going to be taking her to appointments or here with her in the house.
Once a week?
No times a week. You won't have time for that.
This is serious. Now
There's going to be vomiting. There's going to be incontinence, depression, unsightly hair loss, weight loss. She'll be irritable.
Lots of massive mood swings.
Have I already said that?
Transcripted om Addic7ed.com by honeybunny, cRaZyMaGgOt, chamallow35
Hmm.
Fuck. Fucker.
Fuck. Ah.
I need you is that e. Channel on?
You called me up to ask me about the e. Channel?
Jeff and susie
Look at this. Look at this.
I can't open those packages. appointment tomorrow at noon
Well, just move it to another te.
I can't move it to another time.
Can you play before or after?
Well, why don't you drive?
Cause i have cancer
Yes, i do.
But how does it affect your driving?
The doctor didn't say anything about driving.
And maybe ask about the driving? you know what it feels like
And tomorrow at noon take me to my appointment.
Noon tomorrow.
No golf.
I'm going to dinner tonight
With jeff, susie and lewis and his new girlfriend.
Hey, i've got a friend named alton, right.
Loved the freaking show.
He's a little depressed right now. could give him a call on his birthday?
I don't know why the guy so depressed with a wife that damn fine.
I've never seen the damn show myself,
But he fricking swears by it.
He's gonna fucking flip out,
Well, my next guest is, to say the least,
A maverick in the field of cancer treatment.
Her newest book is titled walking out on cancer.
Please say hello to dr. Karen trundle.
Can contribute to their cancer,
If i determine that a patient of mine
Is in a toxic relationship with their spouse,
I will counsel them to leave that spouse.
When we're talking about a toxic spouse,
We're talking about what?
And obsesses over meaningless details
At the expense of a harmonious relationship.
And you saw that they were
I would counsel them to leave and to never look back. how they walk out on cancer?
We've got a couple of
Drink it up. You're doing great.
Attagirl. Good job. Good job.
Hey, i heard about this great doctor
And i took the liberty of
The doctor you have is perfectly fine
But get a second opinion.
Okay, all right. Second opinion.
I've got a very good feeling about this doctor,
I'm a friend of leon's. He told me to give you a call.
I can believe you're calling me.
He's not talking about your wife.
He just said she was beautiful.
Yeah, okay. Well, i know she's beautiful
But why is leon telling you that my wife is beautiful?
That's like another man looking at another man's woman.
I've seen them together at the house talking,
Happy birthday and good luck. See you around.
Yeah. Yeah yeah. She's beautiful, huh?
And you've got to swear to secrecy.
On the way over here,
Wow, how gentile.
Not gonna get that close to her, i can tell you that.
It has to affect the driver. I can't deny it.
I think it should be illegal, frankly.
By the way, why do they call it a job?
It's a lot of work. I wouldn't want to do it.
Hi. Larry. Hi.
Where have you guys been, huh?
Just talking, catching up.
Don't you guys want a drink? No drinks. is that? That looks interesting.
Here, have a try.
Antioxidants, tequila.
It's fabulous. Mmm.
I don't like to take sips.
I don't. I don't take bites either.
No bites, no sips. Yeah.
I'm starving.
A pleasure. Pleasure.
You going to michael york's party?
Michael york's party. You know, i really love michael york, boondocks. I'll never find the place.
What about that nav system we gave you?
I was stabbing it with a knife. It's impossible.
There's a tab. You pull the tab.
I gotta buy a box cutter?
What a piece of crap. put butter up my ass.
I mean, is that supposed to be a movie?
That's what you've got there.
You know nothing about foreign films or anything. It's all about you.
What's the problem with you?
Holy
What the fuck did you do?
She wanted you to have a little drink. You wouldn't take it.
She wanted to kiss you goodbye like an aunt in brooklyn
At a seder. You can't even do that?
What is she, a leper, for christ's sake?
I'll never get laid again.
Just tell the whole restaurant.
Larry.
Why'd you tell alton i was fucking his wife?
What? Come here. What are you saying?
You told alton i'm fucking his wife?
No, i said that you said that his wife was beautiful,
And that's all i said.
That's all i said.
When you said that shit to him,
That's implying that i'm fucking her. that ass for a while now.
Why do you fool around with married women?
Well, you don't have to tap every ass.
Do you? Do you have to tap every ass?
What the fuck we gonna do right now?
I have nothing to do with this. I'm not tapping anybody.
You're tapping. I'm not tapping.
You are combined in this shit with me now, god damn it.
We are lego. We are a fucking lego set right now.
We are fucking interlocked together. We fucked her.
Get away from me. Get out of here. $10.
First of all, loretta, i want to say
It's like how horses do it, right?
And i can see why they do it. It feels good.
What is it exactly?
What, i'm supposed to have a connection to her 'cause i'm black?
Duh.
A happy, healthy, committed relationship?
A happy and a healthy new year to you. talking about our relationship right now. get along most of the time.
Who's this guy? Is that your husband?
No, i wasn't referring to you at all.
Bald people are not blessed?
This has nothing to do with you.
We don't belong on the same planet as the blessed hairs?
Now, as i was saying, the type of relationship that you have,
You know, the
Yeah, maybe you'll find a magazine out there
You'll have coffee. You'll discuss.
Discuss. You'll talk. You'll do this. You'll do that.
I'll be out there. You'll be here.
We'll
Larry david. Dean. Dean weinstock.
Don't worry about it.
I'll send you a bill.
Where'd you guys move to?
You'll send me a bill? break your glasses.
It was the hug that broke 'em.
Yeah, i came in
No, i came in for a shake and then i saw you make a move for the hug,
I think you're mistaking my hey for a hug.
That still doesn't make me responsible for your glasses.
They're your glasses.
They're around your neck.
With all due respect, i feel like you didn't recognize me
Then i did the hey,then i did,
You overcompensated by a superstrong hug
I think, because you're a needy person,
First of all, i'm not a needy person.
I wasn't overcompensating. I don't like you. Why would i want to hug you?
I'm not asking you to pay for the glasses.
I'm asking you to replace these glasses that you broke.
I'm still paying for them even if i replace them,
Am i not? What's the difference?
Okay, you send me the invoice. I'm going to rip it up into tiny little pieces
We're fighting because you're a moron. That's why we're fighting.
You know i have cancer, right?
You know that's why i'm here.
I don't want to have a fight with you.
In fact, my doctor said to not have any fights at all.
Okay,
I'll pay for the glasses.
You'll replace the glasses.
I'll pay for the glasses.
I appreciate you accepting responsibility.
It feels good, right?
I got a pretty good vibe from that doctor.
Pretty pretty
Pretty pretty good.
Yeah, she's pretty smart.
Yeah. Yeah, what did you guys talk about?
She told me there's certain things i've got to do to make sure i get well.
Well, you got to do 'em, you've got to do 'em.
You've got to listen to the doctor.
I would like to go to her lecture tomorrow.
You know what? I'll drive you. How about that?
What can i do for you?
You killed another relationship.
This is maybe the most special one i ever had.
Really? The last one was special.
I made a mistake on that one.
There have been quite a few special girls.
I've made mistakes. Not this one.
This one's more special?
This is the most special.
Is she the most special out of all the special girls you've taken out?
That's right, and she needs an apology.
What do you want me to say?
You'd better get me out of this.
Hey, beverly.
But,
You're right on my neck here.
Just back up a little bit.
About not kissing you in the restaurant. That was bad.
But jeff told me that you gave lewis a blowjob in the car
Before you got to the
Blowjob? What the fuck are you talking about?
Look, i haven't had a blowjob in about five years,
You're not gonna have one for another fucking five years.
I thought the truth was that you had a cold sore
For christ's' sake. That's what the truth would have been.
What? No no no. I made up the cold sore
Cause i didn't want to kiss her. Anyway, you went like this.
That's the sign for blowjob.
That's a blowjob sign.
That's a blowjob, buddy, where i come from. Yeah.
Kiss her goodbye? She's got your semen on her lips. I'm not gonna kiss her.
You can't be a homosexual by proxy.
It's probably in the fucking constitution.
I think you can be gay by proxy.
How am i going to get home by the way?
Eh, you take a bus.
Not even smart, brilliant. She's brilliant.
I get it. You were impressed. Okay?
Enough with the dr.
Trundle and the brilliance.
I get your point, okay?
Hey, dr. Trundle's husband.
Yeah. I remember him from the picture.
Yeah, right. Yeah, i saw him yesterday in the reception area.
Yeah.
Is that dr. Trundle?
Could you please give this to dean weinstock? He's a patient here.
Hi, what a surprise.
I would love to talk to you. Do you have a minute?
This way.
Come on in.
I wanted to tell you how disappointed i was
That you and loretta were not at the lecture yesterday.
And i think the reason that you weren't there
Was because you recognized
That i am going to recommend that she leave the relationship.
That terrifies you and that's why
You didn't want her to be there.
No no, that's the furthest thing from the truth.
I have a lot of experience with this,
And i find that men often have this reaction.
It's certainly understandable.
It's very threatening.
But the fact is we're talking about a woman's life
It's not true. I reject your hypothesis.
Why didn't she come to the lecture?
Okay, i'm going to tell you.
I noticed your husband in the car ahead of us.
Then you picked your head up off of his lap
And loretta decided that she didn't want anything to do
With a doctor who would, you know, do that.
Who would do what?
My husband was driving the car,
And yes, i dropped my cell phone on his side of the car,
And i was looking for the cell phone.
An awful long time to look for the cell phone.
Yes. You are a tiny,
Little, insecure, infantile mind
Of about a
You have nothing better in your mind than that?
You're out of control.
You brought his wife here? You idiot. to run up all in here
Yeah, you come up here, rushing
Okay. Now come on. Get in the car. Get in the car.
We getting the hell out of here and we ain't never coming back.
Give your ass a little bit of a taste of chocolate,
And next thing you know, you cheating on me?
That's right. I saw your ass,
Fuck you, larry david.
They're gone. We had a big fight.
They're not coming back.
Hey, lewis, it's me.
I'm on my way to michael york's.
Maybe i'll see you there.
Otherwise, i'll talk to you tomorrow.
Okay, bye.
She was giving you a blowjob?
She gave me the finger
How's it feel living alone?
Well, i'm not alone.
I know i brought it up a million times,
But nbc is still harping me about
About doing a seinfeld reunion.
They never work. The actors are 10 years older.
It just doesn't look right.
All right, look. I'm in agreement with you
But here's what i need, okay?
Say no. That way i can always say to them,
He said no. You heard it from him.
We move on to other things. None of this crap.
My knees ache.
I feel weak. I've
Everybody says i'm fine. It's in my head,
Which is bullshit. As you know, i'm always happy and up.
You are a picture of happiness.
I've never been so
Have you been in any tall grass lately?
Well, you know, on fire island i was in tall grass.
I was on the dunes, in the grass when we were there.
Have you been tested for lyme disease?
And then it turned out to be lyme disease.
What have you got to lose? Take a blood test.
What are you, a fucking doctor?
I can't believe it.
This is the second time
I've run into you in, what, three weeks?
How do you know? What are you doing here?
I have a meeting
With jeff and nbc about a seinfeld reunion,
I'm not gonna do it. perfect. People love reunion shows.
How much would people love to see that cast back together?
See what they're doing now, years later, and how they look?
My god. You have to write a part for me.
I'm learning japanese and i'm into the lakers.
They are into it and we're going on thursday night,
About going to that game. I was gonna buy scalper's tickets.
That every affiliate asks me
Is when are we going to get a 'seinfeld' reunion?
Well, the window is wide open right now and it's kind of perfect.
What are you thinking? Hour, half hour?
I am thinking whatever you want to do.
What are you thinking?
Do you want to do an hour?
Do you want to do a half hour? We don't care.
Really? 'Cause i can try it different way if you want me to. a thing. It's perfect.
And as far as the rest of you go,
I've got a couple of little things.
I loved the entrance.
That slide? It's working.
Well, it's making me a bit dizzy,
But i'll do anything for you, larry.
Julia, the business
Come on, how funny is that?
Hey, it was your idea and it completely works.
The glasses? You're killing me.
I can't do it as good as you, but i'm gonna keep trying.
And i have a pretty good idea for george too.
He's gotten married, divorced
And now he's gonna try to get his wife back.
I know it's not a great idea, but i can work on it.
We were gonna try to go thursday night.
You should've brought this idea up a long time ago.
Gotta call jerry.
You know who you've got to call?
Cheryl, to tell her that she's gonna be
In a seinfeld reunion show.
We're sitting up there, you say i'll do it
And i'm going really? You'll do it?
And literally, it hit me the second we walked out of that meeting.
To get your exWife back.
Pretty fucking brilliant if you ask me. her every day on the set,
Directing her, working with her.
And already she started looking at me differently
Pretty brilliant.
I've got this really good idea for george.
He's gotten married, divorced
And now he's trying to get his exWife back.
But anyway, there's no shortage of ideas.
I mean, i remember
Whenever a sitcom does a reunion episode
You say, isn't it pathetic?
We'd see them do reunion shows,
You would look and
Who do not have your aesthetic standards.
You criticize and downgrade them for it.
That's your style.
What's not quite clear to me
Is how you seem to have shifted
Your whole attitude about these shows.
And i don't know why. I get that funny feeling,
Like when you're in a car showroom
And the guy is just trying to close that deal on the car. that you suddenly like an idea
That you always always hated.
I don't know. It'd just be fun to get together.
Get together?
You don't like to get together.
You hate to get together.
We could have a dinner. Why don't we just have a nice dinner?
I just think that everybody wants it.
Why are we depriving them of this? It's crazy.
I know, but it's like you're going back to an old girlfriend
And saying hey, maybe i can make it work now, 10 years later.
Does that ever work in any relationship that you can think of?
Robert wagner and natalie wood. How about that?
They got divorced and they got back together.
And then she slipped off the boat and died.
And christopher walken?
How do you explain that?
I don't know what he was doing on the boat.
Why isn't it lame?
Isn't it lame?
Because we'll do it in a way that won't be lame.
If i get the others, will you go along with it?
I guess i would, yeah.
And what about that story you were talking
Are you kidding me? thing the other night.
She got up and talked, she looks great.
You know what? Casting will take care of itself.
Okay.
No one's gonna buy it.
The character is unlovable. jerky, schmucky little character.
All right? He's just a buffoon.
Why is he unappealing?
People loved the character.
Cause we all know schmucks like that.
It could make up for the finale. That's for sure.
What does that mean?
There's nothing to make up for.
It really lets us end seinfeld on a good note.
It could be a we know.
On that level i like it.
And, creatively, it makes
What's going on in this restaurant?
Boy, those are distracting, huh?
Everybody is down for this?
But i'm gonna meet with her tomorrow. Jerry'll do it if you do it. haven't spoken to him yet,
But i'm gonna mewit.
All right. You know what? Let's do it.
You know what? Let's do it. I'm excited.
For george's exWife, if we get one of these great actresses
That has the little
You know, like a jennifer tilly, like a kristin chenoweth.
You don't need to concern yourself so much with who's playing george's wife. gonna be writing with me.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
What are you going to leave?
Let's coordinate the tip here.
What, are we favored nations all of a sudden for lunch?
No, but what is the big deal if we both leave the same amount?
What do you want to leave?
What's your inclination?
How much are you gonna leave?
I'm encouraging you to leave $12.
In writing $12 under gratuity on your check.
Are you gonna leave $12?
You want to know what i'm leaving?
I'm gonna write down what i'm leaving right now.
And i'm putting it inside my little leather check holder.
Waiter. Thank you very much.
You're not gonna tell me what you left? Is that it?
I am very excited about our show.
You don't believe in tip coordination, is that it?
Let's stay in touch about the girl. It's very important.
I've got a couple of ideas. I'll email you.
This is exciting, larry.
A little girl asks you to give her doll a haircut. give her the haircut,
She finds out it doesn't grow back and she freaks out.
I have to tell you, larry, i've never seen a reunion show
I mean, every time you see one of these reunion shows,
Completely into it.
He's chomping at the bit.
Champing? What is champing?
I think it's spelled champing but pronounced chomping.
No, it's spelled chomping and it's pronounced chomping.
Well, regardless, on, let's do it.
All right. All right.
How was the birthday party the other day?
What birthday party?
You know, you went to a birthday party with your mother.
No, i didn't go to a birthday party.
That's not what your mother said.
I didn't go to a birthday party.
Huh.
Interesting. good ideas for kramer.
This one idea that
I picked up a hooker so i could use the carpool lane
Jerry will do it. I just talked to julia,
She's in. What do you think?
I mean, am i crazy? Tell me. What do you think?
Am i crazy? Do you think i'm crazy?
I don't know.
Okay, i'm glad you said that.
I'm glad you think i'm crazy.
That means it's a good idea.
If you think it's a crazy idea, then it's a good idea.
If you said, no, you're not crazy,
Then i'd think it's not a good idea.
Come on, let's do it.
How much tip the guy i was with left you?
Honestly, who gives a crap?
I was in here. I was with a guy.
I'm just curious. What did he leave?
Healthy tip.
Was his healthier?
Just scratch your face with your finger if it was over $12. trouble with my manager.
Nobody even knows what we're talking about.
Scratch your face with your finger if it was over $12.
Go ahead, just scratch it. Was it over $12?
Let me ask you this
Just tug on your tie up here. Was it over $15?
This is making me real uncomfortable. to anything we're talking about.
Was it over $15? Tug on your tie.
Is that all i can get you?
No, don't go yet. One second. I have one more question to ask you.
Good. Guess what.
It's unbelievable. Who'd have thunk? Now check this out.
Susie has lyme disease.
I mean, that's kind of scary.
Cheryl. Hey, cheryl.
That i was gonna see them about a seinfeld reunion?
I'm telling you, it was unbelievable.
You should've seen the look on her face.
Thank you.
We'll go see a fantastic game, huh?
Where are these?
Look at this. This has to be a mistake.
He couldn't have given us seats up here.
Can you believe these seats this guy gave us?
Look at this. You've gotta be kidding.
This is crazy. We could've stayed home
Watched it on tv and gotten the same effect.
Why? Why would he do this? Why would
I don't even know how to condition myself to do it.
I thought he had courtside seats. binoculars for a second?
He and david spade.
I'm gonna call him.
He screened my call.
He screened the call. You know, i always thought people were doing that
When i called them.
This just confirms it.
See, it taught me a lesson.
Don't. It's not for you. That's not my thing.
That was a complete and utter waste of time.
Listen. Just don't go nuts.
All right? I know you want
Yeah, i did. The guy said he's gonna fix me up with tickets.
He's apoplectic. Apoplectic, larry.
That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable.
It is totally and completely unacceptable
That you would grill my daughter gracie
About whether i took her to a birthday party.
And then you call me a liar?
Okay, first of all, i didn't really grill her.
I just asked a question.
And i didn't call you a liar.
What about this would you find interesting, larry?
Well, the fact that you told me that you were
Taking her to a birthday party.
In fact, i have two daughters?
Grace and mary.
I took mary to the birthday party.
Is that you would
Go back to a restaurant where you and i had a meal
For the sheer purpose of harassing a waiter
For the most insignificant incident,
I'm sure, that's ever happened in this man's life.
We split a check and he doesn't want to coordinate the tip.
Why do i need to coordinate the tip?
You go out with a friend, you tip in concert.
Why are we in concert?
There's no concert.
He's got a big secret.
What is the big secret?
It's the right thing to do. That's all.
There's no right and wrong to it.
In fact, you're wrong and i'm right.
Because unless you apologize to sandy goodman,
There's not even going to be a reunion show.
What reunion show?
We discussed it the other day at lunch.
You told me point blank. You
Let's do it. It's a great idea. got all the principals,
But the project's in the toilet
Because larry david doesn't want to si.
I don't think that was the loge. That was way up.
Larry, you have got to speak with sandy.
You have got to clean up that mess.
You've got to apologize. left you alone with goodman.
Jerry's right. You've got to apologize.
Fine. you gonna go in begrudgingly a begrudging apology.
You've gotta give a sincere apology.
It's not completely sincere and it's not completely begrudging.
I'll tell you where the
You probably fuck up the apology. That's the line.
If i fuck up the apology, then i'll apologize for the bad apology.
You can't apologize for an apology.
You get one shot, that's it.
Hey, what about cheryl?
There you go.
All right, listen. I've gotta run.I did not.
Don't forget to pick up sammy, okay?
No thank you, larry,
For saving my life?
Saving my life? How'd you save my life?
All right. Well, it's treated, and i'm feeling great.
You saved my life. I'd be dead without you.
You know what happens to lyme disease if it's left untreated?
The kidneys, the joints,
Very glad i'm feeling better, shouldn't you?
You didn't save my life, asshole.
Next time i'm not gonna say anything, okay?
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut and let you die.
You've got a little spot on your forehead.
That little spot you got there.
I just wanted to apologize
If i offended you
Or insulted you
Apologizing.
That's it?
Can i apologize for the apology?
You know what? I want to put the kibosh
On our relationship.
I have aches. I have pains.
In the hamptons over the weekend,
Yes, with my kid. Why?
No reason.
Larry, you saved my life.
Hey, everybody, let's get back to work.
Pick it up from kramer's entrance.
Larry, i want you back.
Let's go home and make love.
Ah.
Our dream cast
For george's exWife.
Isn't this great. George's exWife.
It's such a great idea.
Anyway, i just wanted to say thanks. Here's jerry.
We are gold.
Try not to wear shorts.
It's not all that attractive to look at for five hours.
I'm comfortable in pajamas, but
I don't wear pajamas on a plane.
I like to sing. I like to whistle.
I like to play the bongos on my leg.
Wow, you're very uptight, dude. Very uptight.
What if they were a woman's in a skirt?
Would you say that to her if a woman's in a skirt?
Are you ready for a hot towel?
She must've put it in the microwave.
Don't you think? I mean, have you ever seen anything like this is your life?
I bet you I could sue em. Don't you think?
Do I have a case? Tell me.
I find that odd and troubling.
Yeah, it would be hato find a d, in good conscience, settlement for that burn.
Okay. I'll drop it.
I am loving the music in the waiting room.
I'm glad you like it.
A new italian restaurant called matteo's.
I need to buy an anniversary gift for my friends.
Okay.
You know what?
I was just thinking.
You know, I understand all that, but I would feel better, you know.
It would make me feel more secure.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'm never gonna call.
Why does he have the privilege of talking to you and not me?
You make the call. They call me, then I respond to you.
It works like a charm.
It works every time.
I don't want to be in your wallet.
I want you in my wallet. purely in the interest of getting on with my day.
I do not expect you to abuse it and I don't want you to call me directly at home, all right?
Jeez. Mary jane.
Thank you. How are things?
I just came from the doctor.
I've got two months to live.
You regret breaking up with me though.
We should go out. We should go out and catch up.
I've ever gone out with in my life.
Believe me. I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
Mozzarella? Yeah.
Do you remember mary jane porter?
One of my favorites.
I don't know why she went out with me.
I don't know. That's a good question.
She could sense the insecurity.
Yeah. She asked me.
Maybe she's got the desperation this time.
Everything you've done before counts.
Yes. I don't know.
In terms of unhooking bras, i'm really gonna be in trouble.
I can't unhook righty.
It's from the car, I think, when you park. you lean over, it's your left hand that's doing the unhooking.
Right, you get used to the left. It's like the one thing if you're a righty that you do with your left hand with skill.
Hopefully we can cast her in this thing and see what happens.
Please. Why not?
Mary jane porter asking you.
Hey, what did you get ted and mary?
Susie gets all the gifts. No idea.
A $300 gift certificate to matteo's restaurant.
Have you been there?
It's supposed to be great.
Are you sure you wanna give that much?
I can't believe you did that.
Is it a lot better than the gifts you've been getting?
Of course. The host has to circulate.
Everybody wants to talk to the hosts of course.
Hello, I'm the host of the party.
Good. You know, I ran into a friend of yours today.
Jesus christ.
It's the best caviar they could possibly get.
It's unbelievable. What do you think I'm gonna do, pass this up?
Just an observation. Not a big deal.
Well, it's good that you're here to patrol the hor d'oeuvres area.
You know, it's an unwritten law.
What you should be doing here is you take a little bit, then you step away for 20 minutes, see what kind of action there is. maybe take a little bit more, step away again.
Let me just scoop a little more on here and I'm gonna step away then. eat all that caviar?
I mean, everybody knows you take a little, right?
Christian slater was eating gobfuls of it.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
Happy anniversary to an incredible couple.
We didn't know what to get you.
You clearly have everything.
Are you kidding?
This is the worst thing
I've ever heard in my life.
All right. Okay. That's good. That's good.
No no, she's not done.
What are you doing?
That was very good. Very good.
Why are you interrupting her, larry?
You ruined the whole gift. That was our gift for god's sake.
Let's give her a nice round of applause. That was good.
That was good. Yeah.
Hey. Real nice. Real nice.
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
What? What did she say?
She said that you told her that I helped myself to too much caviar.
Well, she noticed the caviar and asked me who ate it.
What? What? Was I supposed to lie?
It's there to be eaten, you know?
Smile.
Hey, mind your own business. How about that? smile.
Your patient larry david.
And wasn't it just a couple of days ago that I saw you and asked you not to call here?
No, I wasn't calling you.
I distinctly recall asking you not to call me.
No no, I didn't call.
How can you say you didn't call?
Look. I'm in the other room i'm working. I had to walk in here.
I had to pick up the phone.
Now I'm talking to you. That's a call.
I've ever had in my life.
I have things to do, Mr David. and cleaning the cat's litter box.
Don't ask me what I do at home.
All right. I'm gonna hang up then.
You don't have to tell me everything you're doing. Just hang up.
Okay. The next time you hear from me will be in case of an emergency, and I hope you don't hear from me.
Call them, ask about their day.
Don't bother me.
Not yet. Should I hang up now?
Yes, I'm going to hang up now.
Did I mention that I'm going to the restaurant tonight?
Goodbye.
By the way, I'm not that impressed with the food.
It's good.
I can't believe Dr. Morrison recommended it. It's terrible.
You don't like food.
Every time we've gone out,
You are the only one that thinks that.
I'm planning on a big move later and I think I might hurt my chances if I keep criticizing your food.
A big big move.
Ted danson?
No, he's over there.
Yeah, it's really weird.
I'll be right back. frankly, that I got you this $300 gift certificate to the restaurant and you chose to take them and not me.
But if we took you, wouldn't that be you giving a gift to yourself?
From now on don't get us a gift. No more gifts.
At least I got you a gift, okay?
You had no right to shut her up.
My father used to sing in the house all the time. I couldn't take it.
It's bullshit. He's making it up.
I'm not making it up. This happens to be the truth.
Hey hey hey. Hey hey.
That's okay. We've got it. We've got it.
We've got it. We're good. Hey.
We're good. We're good.
Pipe it down. We're good. We're good.
That's okay. Lock it up.
Lock it up. We're good.
Very good. It was very good.
We're eating. We can't listen now.
Come on. Right, people?
We don't need that. Come on.
Damn it.
Hey, would you mind switching sides?
It is delicious and I'm not kidding.
All right, I'll try it.
You've got to be quiet.
It's like on the discovery channel.
Fuck.
My boyfriend's coming over.
You didn't tell me you had a boyfriend.
It didn't come up. You didn't ask me.
Well, it should've come up. No?
You've got to go. Larry, please.
He will not understand this situation.
Yeah, I don't understand the situation.
He will kill me. He will kill you. We can talk about it later.
I'm not kidding. The food was just awful.
Terrible. Honestly, I can't even believe you recommended that.
It was a complete accident.
Well, perhaps, but it was intrusive.
You have a beautiful home, by the way.
How do you know that?
You're right in my neighborhood.
You're right up the street.
Arbor. Yeah, you've got the arbor in the front.
There should be a little more openness in the doctor business.
I have too many patients. I don't want them all to have my information.
Well, I'm the only one who has it.
In my opinion, it'd be better to leave it open.
I don't quite see the connection.
I just don't see how I can trust your medical recommendation.
They're different.
He found your bandage in the garbage can here and he knows it's you.
He knows you were here.
Are you crazy? What did you do that for?
I didn't know what to do.
I was running and I saw your house.
Mr David, what the hell are you doing here?
I just need a place to stay.
If I could just stay here for a while, spend the night.
I'll close the door. You won't even know I'm here.
I'm sitting here having a nice, quiet night with my wife, we're having a glass of wine, and you bust in here saying
Please please please don't involve Mrs Morrison.
I'm not involving her. You have a lovely home by the way.
And I think it's a little provocative, coming in here like this in front of my wife with no pants on. You should go home and get dressed.
I was running out. I ran out of the house.
You drive by my house.
Now you're in my house?
How about if I just hang out here? I'll sit on the steps.
What, all night? Sit on the steps?
Do you mind if I stay on the steps, Mrs Morrison?
You're not staying on the steps.
You know, you're a doctor.
You're sending me out to get hurt.
What about the hippocratic oath?
When you're hurt, come back and I'll treat you.
I'm calling an emergency call to you.
Don't call me, and I'll call you.
There's a guy after me.
I swear to god. I'm not making it up.
He can't sing anymore because of you.
Yeah, build up his confidence after that.
I actually will. I'll do that.
You are a selfish motherfucker.
Mary jane porter's boyfriend is after me.
I won't bother you. I won't even use the kitchen.
I swear to you I'll just stay in the guest room. too good to be true ? ? can't take my eyes off of you ?
What the fuck? Shut the fuck up.
Jesus christ.
You ingrate. You hurt sammy one more time, larry.
Get the fuck out of my house,kay?
You squashed the spirit of a talented young girl.
You piece of shit. You heartless piece of shit.
Honestly, it really wasn't you.
I'm meeting christian slater and his girlfriend here and my boyfriend's in the bathroom right now.
Hey hey. Excuse me. Hey hey.
Hey hey. Hey.
You're not looking for larry david by any chance, are you?
Yeah, I am.
Who are you listening to?
What?
Who are you listening to?
I saw her at disney hall. I was in seats right down front.
You're gonna be really jealous when I tell you this.
What?
I'm seeing her in a private recital at a friend's house.
It's music to my ears.
You know what? If I knew you better I'd invite you.
Yeah, how do we arrange that?
Well, you know what? Maybe we should have a little predate.
A predate date.
You're halfway decent looking.
I think we could arrange it.
It's those compliments that just keep me going.
Yeah. Yeah, let's arrange it.
I am. I'm a total creep.
Okay, creepy.
Larry.
Well, you know, there's a technique to firing.
If you deliver bad news like it's bad news, it's gonna be bad news.
If you deliver bad news like it's not a big deal, then it's not a big deal.
You have terminal cancer.
It's a little bit mean and insensitive, larry. You should think about that.
I'm thinking about them, to let them down easy.
And by the way, susie,
Hey, did you call the wheelchair girl?
I didn't want her to thinki was.
It's an adventure. It's an adventure.
What's going on with the seinfeld show?
I know, I'm really looking forward to it.
Come on, it's the inviter who picks up.
I had first dibs. I touched it first, larry.
I asked, though. I think that gets priority.
What gets priority on a check, asker or toucher?
What is he, judge judy?
I put my hand on it.
No. Give me the check, rosie.
Hey hey hey.
Hey hey, get off. Come on. Come on.
Are you kidding? Of course I'm coming.
I'm a huge fan of hers. My god.
We just got her six months ago.
Hello, kelsey. Kelsey. Kelsey grammer.
Have you noticed if she has any proclivity for chopsticks? if you took an american kid who's never used chopsticks before and a chinese kid who's never used chopsticks before, would the chinese kid do better?
First time she uses chopsticks, give me a call.
Give me a call and say, you wouldn't believe it. This kid's amazing. do you have any concerns that one of the biological parents could be a psychotic?
You don't want to have a schizophrenic on your hands.
If we're gonna have a second date, you're gonna have to get an electric chair.
This looks nice.
Where's the ramp?
Where is the ramp?
Are you kidding me? There's no ramp?
By the time we get to the car and get to another restaurant it's gonna be an hour.
Well, what if I carried you?
It'll be one two three. We'll be up there before you know it.
Okay.
Lift with your legs.
Two more steps, go.
Jesus, that really got my back.
Yeah.
I feel it radiating down my leg.
I'll take a cart.
Yeah, don't you take a cart anyway?
No, that's not true.
That's not true at all. I never walk.
Walking is completely overrated.
Wouldn't be caught dead walking.
Always take a cart. I'm not a walker.
I would think that it would be nice to walk on a golf course.
No, not nearly as good as taking a cart.
In fact, I don't do much walking at all.
Generally I'm just walking from one place to sit to the other place to sit.
Can I be perfectly honest?
When I walked into your house you gave me this look like,
When we first met you were wearing a hat.
You're bald and I didn't know that you were bald.
Like I said, it's no big deal.
I get it.
I had a hat on and then baldy showed up.
I just didn't know.
You feel I misrepresented myself.
I mean, you're the one who has to live with it.
By the way, what's the proper term? Can I say handicapped?
What is it? Are you disabled? Handicapped?
Challenged? Are you challenged?
Right now I am, yeah.
Okay.
Well, there's your date. That's your date.
Right. Because I'm handicapped?
What? No, of course not.
Okay.
Let's see.
Mmm.
How do other people do this?
Hmm.
Interesting.
He's a fucking asshole. be best for everyone if you didn't come to anywhere near kelsey.
What's up, man?
You got in kind of late last night, right?
How was the date with that wheelchair chick?
Yeah, and there was like no reaction at all. if it's because I was bad and didn't know what I was doing, or if it's just her condition.
Coma, fucking handicapped, any of that shit.
I don't think you fucking brung it.
I'm telling you I brung it. I know when I bring it and I know when I don't bring it, and I brought it.
You did your dizzle on her, right?
Yeah, I did my dizzle.
I'll have her ass like a goddamn pretzel.
You should've broke that ass in two pieces.
You know what I'm saying? You should've came back with the bottom half of the ass.
I'll have to do it when I see her.
It's not gonna be easy.
Look at this. No spaces.
I can't find a parking space.
Just park in the handicapped spot in front of the restaurant.
Handicapped spot? How am I gonna do that?
What a parking space.
How about this ramp?
Are you loving this ramp?
Right this way, please.
This way.
And we're gonna start you off with a couple of glasses of champagne.
Cheers
I hope you two saved room.
Hey.
But I don't have any room. I am stuffed.
I'm kinda full myself. I don't think i'm really in the mood for that.
No problem, sure. I'll just get this out of the way for you
This pie is the best pie
I've ever had in my entire life. You will love the pie.
Thank you. This is denise, by the way, ted.
Yeah, nice to meet you too. Very nice.
Very nice. Little surprising, but nice.
You're gonna love this. It is the best piece of pie you've ever had.
Just have one bite.
Have a bite, come on.
I'm not in the mood, ted. I don't want it.
Thank you. It's a nice gesture.
You're making me look like an asshole.
I had the option of ordering dessert and I didn't want the dessert at the time.
I don't have to take a bite just because you want me to.
Take this fucking piece of pie and get it out of my face.
Is that what she's saying? Get this thing away from me. Thank you very much.
Rosie o'donnell. That's bullshit, by the way.
She got me down, yeah.
Okay, I admit that.
She got me down and I could have reversed it, but it was stopped. People interfered. That's all.
Why are you fighting women?
That's right.
Yeah.
Good for us. Look at us.
Or do you already have it?
I hate it at the beach.
Who likes the feeling of sand in their feet?
Even more than I hate the feeling of sand in my feet,
I hate the feeling of sand in my sneakers.
And it lasts for years afterwards.
If you wear your sneakers once on the beach, you never get it out.
Get up off your fat ass and let's take a walk. It'll be romantic.
See? Don't you feel better now?
Help. Help.
Sammi.
One second.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Larry.
Help, larry.
Larry, help.
Sammi, are you okay? Are you all right?
I was going into the water but then
I realized I had the blackberry.
Threw it right in the water.
She was in my blackberry under denise handicap.
That's how I remember these names.
Don't you do that in your blackberry?
I've got shawn yoga. You know, the yoga instructor.
Nancy big tits. I know nancy's got big ass tits.
Jonel sweet ass. That's the only way I know who the fuck it is.
That's smart, you know?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can't just vanish into thin air. That would be terrible.
I mean, imagine doing that with a walker, okay?
With a handicapped woman, just not call her like that, you can't do that. I'll be a pariah.
If you saw the house, would you recognize it?
Let's just take a drive.
Maybe we can find it.
I think this is it. I think this is the neighborhood.
Every time you go to a white neighborhood everything looks fucking nice and clean and shit.
When shit is too clean you can't fucking tell where the fuck you at.
You know what I mean?
Is that her right there?
No, that's not her. But you know what? They might know each other.
Handicapped people know other handicapped people, right?
You would think. If you were and there was a brother, you would know the brother, right?
Brother.
That's what it's come down to.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a woman named denise.
I think she lives in this neighborhood. I'm pretty sure.
And she's in a wheelchair much like yourself.
Ah, yeah.
Denise and me and stephan hawking, we hang out all the time, cause we all live in the wheelchair neighborhood.
You don't know her? You've never seen anybody rolling around here?
An attractive woman? no?
I've got work to do.
Okay, larry, if you'll excuse me.
I really was enjoying my day until I met you.
What is this? Who are you listening to?
You wouldn't know her.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go over my playlist.
Let us know if you need anything.
Hey, o'donnell.
Hey, larry. How are you?
You're going around telling everybody you kicked my ass?
I keep hearing from people you kicked my ass.
In a very crowded restaurant with witnesses.
I don't know where you're getting that interpretation from.
All I had to do was make one more move and you were dead.
It was over, larry. I had you. Boom boom, you were down.
Well, assholes don't go out with the disabled, okay?
Check that out. Yeah, she's my date.
She's not my first.
It doesn't mean you're not an asshole when it comes to checks at restaurants.
That was my check, okay? I invited you.
You were my guest. It was my pleasure.
That is bullshit. It was my pleasure.
Listen, who got the bill?
I got the bill at the end.
Know what I'm doing next week?
Know what I'm doing next week?
I'm renting a yacht and i'm calling all our friends and we're taking a yacht to catalina. And you're coming.
And I'm footing the whole freaking bill.
You know what I'm doing?
I'm calling your family, i'm flying them out here first class on a jet, putting them up in a hotel, taking them out to dinner and you. started in just a few minutes.
When this is over, you meet me in the parking lot.
Yeah, telling everybody that she kicked my ass.
She didn't kick my ass.
You think she kicked my ass?
Why didn't you come with denise?
Then I went looking for her and I met wendy.
Wendy? Who's wendy?
Are you kidding me? Denise is here?
What?
Fuck.
What's going on with you?
All these wheelchair girls.
Wow.
That's really funny.
Of course I want to do this. She's my favorite.
One second. I'll be with you in one second.
What? Larry, what the hell is this?
Where were you? I waited and waited.
Yeah.
Wendy wheelchair?
Hello?
What?
You're in the closet?
Who the hell is she?
Wendy wheelchair.
Who is she?
Denise handicap.
It's not my fault.
We may be disabled, but you're disgusting.
Ladies ladies, it's all right.
I'll take it from here.
Get back here, larry.
You get back here.
Jeez.
What are you doing in there?
What, do you got seabiscuit in there with you?
Yeah, I'm taking this new pill.
For george's exwife.
But lisa kudrow
I think you want to go with an unknown for this part.
What's real got to do with what we do?
That happened to me
Cheryl should play this part.
Cheryl.
But cheryl, she's unknown and she lived this part.
You think nixon could have been nixon in frost and nixon?
She can read. Maybe she'll get it.
What is that?
There we go.
There we go.
All right, you guys need anything else?
I can't take it anymore.
Every day, every day.
We have to make a change.
We can't. Julia got her the job.
We can't fire her.
You need to talk to her about her clothing.
Why not?
Are you crazy? You do it.
Are you nuts? This is your forte.
You're smart and eloquent, that's what you are.
This is not a call for eloquence.
This is a call for charm, for, you know, lightness and breeziness. That's you.
You're really the boss.
You're the star of the show.
She'd really respect it coming from you.
I'm white glove. White gloves, larry.
I don't do those things.
When we did the show, you were the one who did this stuff.
Remember the cook? How you told her she was using too much mayonnaise?
And she came back the next day duly chastened, fixed the tuna, fixed the egg salad.
We'll choose.
I win. Do it.
Okay, thank you. Bye.
The bare midriff.
Because if a man was wearing this, you wouldn't go out and say anything to him.
Even if it was a man, I wouldn't want to see that. that? What is that, larry?
Well, that. You know.
But it's not really appropriate attire for an office.
Do you know that I have lost 68 lbs in two years?
You can flaunt 2 and 3 of the day outside of the office.
And then you got 1 and 3 nonflaunt.
Do you have to flaunt 24 hours?
Why not take a break in the flaunt?
Why would I need to take a break in the flaunt?
Hey, look at that woman.
What has she got under there?
That's fucking ridiculous.
I'm out of here.
Done.
I cannot believe she's gone.
I thought maybe she would change what she wore.
But I never thought we could be done with her completely.
But isn't that really why you sent me in?
That's what I thought.
Hey, come on, man.
What's he doing?
Learn to fucking drive, you fuck.
I try never to honk.
I don't know. I use a lot of napkins.
What's going on? Can I sit down?
Come on, scootch over.
It'll be to your right.
It works to your advantage.
Hi, guys. hi.
Why don't you go up?
You'll call me and tell me.
I tried to be very sensitive.
Women dress like that.
He lives in los angeles.
Who do you think you are?
He lives in his own mind. He doesn't know anything about it.
Yeah, what about the guy we didn't like because he was veiny? shade had foamy mouth.
Guys, I think you've forgotten that maureen's mother was our nanny for years and years and she helped me with the girls.
Okay, she is very mentally unstable and right now she's going through a very rough time. All right?
You should. You need to drive over there right now.
Want you back.
You want me to come back?
Yeah.
Honestly, I don't even know what I was thinking about.
I'm fine with the shirt. I'm fine with the whole thing.
You know, whatever's happening there, I'm fine with it.
My stomach? What does that mean?
It's a simple thing, larry.
Maybe an inch further down, cover up the belly button.
That's all. Perfect world, perfect world.
I'd cover that little thing there, the little belly button.
An inch lower. You know, but belly button or no belly button, we want you to come back.
I'm glad we talked, larry.
This is my boss. This is larry.
Seriously? I really look like this guy?
Yes. It was 1962.
You ever think you'd get a guy like me?
No. I don't think my mom did either.
Yeah. Are you looking forwar?
Well, I have to admit that I have been fantasizing a little.
I don't think I know what I'm doing.
Hey.
You don't pull over. Just keep driving.
Wait, he's behind you.
No no no.
Learn how to fucking drive.
He honked.
No honking, no shushing.
But people don't kill you for shushing.
Let me help you with the groceries.
Let me get these out of your way.
Thank you, dear. I'm gonna show you a picture of tom.
Because you're not going to believe. It's uncanny.
Come on, hmm?
The hair, the glasses, everything.
I don't see how you cannot see that.
Okay. oh.
You know, about the bare midriff and the belly button.
I get invited to lunch with you and jerry.
You don't even make believe I'm there.
What am i, marley's ghost?
I was completely in the wrong there and I truly apologize.
I'll tell you why I felt even doubly shitty, because I went to a memorabilia show the other day and I bought you a present.
Thank you. You know what? Keep it on you and you'll give it to me next time I see you.
Fair enough. All right.
Hello?
Larry.
Ehh.
Mom.
You've got to see this.
Come here, come here.
I know.
I mean, you have your wife rules and you have your friend rules.
Yeah, I mean, there was an all right.
No, I'm seeing everything I usually see. cause my whole life has changed.
I went into the bathroom and I called my mother in because there is a painting hanging up of jesus.
It's beautiful.
And he's got a tear coming down on his face. that was never there before.
You know, water?
No no, it was at eye level.
Have you ever witnessed a miracle like that?
I think every erection is a miracle.
I have to quit.
It's just my mother and
I decided after seeing it we can't just keep it to ourselves, you know?
We're going to go and buy and show the whole country our miracle.
And we can't just keep it to ourselves.
Trust your gut, you know.
You splashed him, didn't you?
I splashed him.
No no, don't worry, maureen.
Yes, I will.
Hey you. Put the napkins back.
Two, are you kidding? I got a chicken parmesan sub here.
That's the point. Two.
Damn it.
Good afternoon, sir.
License and registration, please.
Would you mind telling me what I did, officer?
Enzo's.
Yeah? How many napkins they give you?
Two, they give you two napkins.
All right.
Four and six, step forward please.
The rest of you step out to the right.
Okay, what do you think?
I'm confused. I just see bald.
I can't believe you missed the signing.
I don't know. I like a lot of napkins.
Hey, thanks for letting me drive the car, by the way.
Our flashback weekend continues back to 1963.
This is a joe dimaggio bat, by the way.
That is a tough guy.
But he stayed overnight in the hospital.
I'm thinking that counts as a visit though, wouldn't you say?
Put on coats and ties, tweed jackets.
Maybe we'll have a good writing day.
Yeah, then maybe wrestle naked like oliver reed and alan bates.
Shit.
Fuck.
Do you hear that?
Yeah, what is that?
I think it's coming over here.
You did not do that, larry.
Larry, you sprayed on jesus.
I'm taking this medication and it's getting all over the place.
I can't control it.
There was no miracle?
Mom?
Where did she go?
Larry. Mom?
I don't know. I don't get it.
Mom? Larry.
Hang on, larry. Hang on.
Larry.
I don't know. I don't remember.
I haven't been here in years. past away?
Dad, you spelled passed wrong.
It's not spelled passed away.
I know how to spell it.
That's $50 a letter.
You spelled it wrong on purpose to save $100?
Yes, why not?
It has the same meaning.
Everybody knows what it means.
I would've paid for it.
I didn't ask you because I didn't want to bother you.
That was the whole idea.
I gotta change this.
You got the name of the stonemason?
I'm gonna spell it the right way.
And what about some blandishments on here?
You wanted maybe $6,000 more on the stone?
Why not just adele david born, passed away?
How long do we have to stay here?
Lucky he didn't put beloved moth.
Hey hey hey. Norm's here.
We've got to hurry up.
Let's eat.
Let's order. he's the slowest golfe in t.
Let's order breakfast and beat him to the first tee.
I'm gonna have egg whites with a bagel. Quickly, please.
I don't want them limp.
I really want them crispy.
Andy, andy, do me a favor.
No no, it takes a long time
Believe me. I've ordered this before. I know exactly what I want.
Yeah, taking
Why didn't you introduce us?
He's from new york. You're never gonna see him again.
It's a courteous thing to do.
He has to know your name and shake your hand?
It's a common courtesy when you're talkinn t.
I can't talk here.
I'm in the dining room.
You shouldn't use the phone in here.
Come on. Tell him you'll call him back.
Great.
I'll see you then.
No cell phone in dining room. Club rule.
My father had a quadruple bypass surgery yesterday and he needed to hear my voice.
You do this all time.
Will you please finish shoveling that shit into your face?
It's exactly how I wanted it done.
I told you those onions
A couple of minutes longer than you guys.
It wasn't a couple of minutes.
We've been done for five.
All right.
Let's hit it.
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
No, they're not going to the range. They don't go to the range.
You know what they do here?
It's an 18 percents tip included.
And then they have a space for an additional tip.
I have to start doing ma in my head now?
I'm leaving an extra $2?
That makes me look cheap.
Just leave the 18 percents and let's go.
I think that's all they expect.
I'm not leaving any more additional tips here. I'm protesting it.
I swear to you i'm gonna protest it.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.
Have a good round.
And usually when I've provided excellent service, my customers like to tip me.
Well, there is an 18 percents tip included.
Generally, I do leave an additional tip, but you know what? I'm kind of protesting the additional tip.
Yes. Let 'em charge me 20 percents. Let 'em charge me 25 percents.
It's not that much.
It's 2 percents.
Okay, you have a system.
I don't have a system to get to 2 percents.
I'm protesting math.
Exactly. 20 minutes he's looking for this ball.
I know.
Hey, norm, drop a ball.
You can't hold up the whole course like this. Let us play through.
You don't play through.
Out of the question.
It's not right.
It's very inconsiderate.
I'm not inconsiderate.
You're inconsiderate.
I can't find the goddamn ball.
Crispy onions.
They have to be crispy. i can't eat breakfast unless I have crispy onions.
Hey, you.
Yes, you.
Did you have to yell and scream at norm out there?
You're very inconsiderate.
He's looking for a ball for half an hour.
I didn't know he has high blood pressure.
They have a heart attack and they die.
That's exactly what happened. Norm is dead.
Now I know that everything that I've heard
What did you hear?
Tell me what you heard.
No, you're not a murderer.
You're not a murderer.
It's involuntary manslaughter.
You didn't intend to kill him, but you killed him. but you killed him.
You did.
Hey, let me the minute you wanted those crispy onions, you put a gun to that guy's head.
You're right. If he hadn't ordered those eggs that way, you wouldn't be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
What time are we playing tomorrow?
Early.
She astounds me.
Look at this.
This is what I live to do. It's my passion.
I have to work.
Listen, kids cost a lot of money nowadays.
We got health insurance and school and college.
It's tough to live in new york.
We're saving already for college.
Okay. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna pay for skylar to go to college.
I don't have any kids.
I have money.
I'll do it. I don't want you to worry about that.
I'm gonna make you
Don't make me
It's done.
You know what would be a great thing that you could do?
If you could show it to some of your celebrity friends,
Okay, well you know passed away is written on there
Who was that yankee you had on seinfeld?
That guy sucks.
He's the most overrated player in baseball.
Larry, come on back.
There's no way he deserves that kind of money he's making.
Okay, you know what?
Do me a favor and just take care of the stone, please?
Where is everybody? Yesterday it was packed. Nobody's here.
I think it's out of respect for norm.
Right by the pond.
You're right by the pond.
Enjoy the swans.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
And then I looked up and he started coming towards me.
He attacked me.
He leapt at me.
You know this is takahashi's pet swan.
This is the love of his life.
You think I wanted to kill it?
I didn't want to kill a swan.
Well, we're gonna have to call animal control
Nobody's calling anybody.
You got that?
Nobody's calling anybody. We'll get kicked out of the club.
Okay. Well, I gotta tell my wife.
Hey.
No wives. Nobody.
Come on, I tell my wife everything.
You tell your wife everything?
She won't tell anybody, but I got to tell her.
My wife thinks i'm at the office.
The only time I tell her I'm playing golf is when I'm with another woman.
You got to cover your tracks.
All right.
Fine.
We got to bury this thing now.
Yeah, let's bury it.
This is horrible.
I want to throw up. We should get out of here.
I want to get out of here now.
Swan killers leave.
There's nothing wrong.
Get it?
Guess what?
I'm not a swan killer.
Okay?
Hey, let me remind you you're talking way too loud about swan killing in the dining room.
How many rules are you gonna break, okay?
You're not supposed to have your phone on. It's always ringing.
Why did I order turkey?
I should've just had the eggs and onions.
I know they're good here.
Will you do me a favor and shut up about your food?
He's right. All you're doing is complaining about your food.
I told you to get the fruit.
It's delicious.
I had fruit this morning. What am I gonna order it twice for?
You get the acid. It'll rip a hole in your stomach.
They have nonacidic fruit. You got papaya and mango and banana.
Hey, uh, what's that? but it's not what you're thinking.
Look.
Clubhouse.
Now what are we gonna do?
What could it have possibly done to you?
You should've seen when it leaped in the air.
Why even bury it? Why were you thinking of burying it?
You know what this is?
This is tee sheet.
It tells me who played and who did not play.
Only one other group played.
Course not crowded.
Why?
You no respect norm?
Although he was a slow player.
What else you not respect?
Beautiful black swan?
We adore swans.
My beautiful black swan kyoko was killed, murdered.
Who killed kyoko?
You.
I don't know you.
If I may say, I think the food here is just great.
No, sir.
You.
You smart guy.
But you know who kill swan.
No, I don't think I do.
You tell me, free dues.
No more dues.
If you tell me.
Yes.
She does have a big mouth.
Yes, maybe I talk to her.
No, don't call her.
I don't even bring her around anymore out of respect. oh.
Larry.
Yeah?
I can't talk now.
I'll call you back.
No cell phone in the clubhouse.
Last warning.
Now go. go.
Two days in a row. This is worse than playing behind him.
Anyway, I came in to thank you for your gracious offe for putting skylar through college.
I mean, my wife and I were talking about it in bed last night.
And you know what cassie said to me?
Would I put her through cosmetology school?
She's great with lotions.
I have to say i'm very put off by this. to pay for your daughter's education and now you want me to put your wife through cosmetology school?
No, I just think it's wrong.
It's very wrong of you to ask me that.
What's happening?
You're saying no?
Yes, I'm saying no.
I just thought it would be a gesture. It would be nice.
I'm not saying it wasn't a beautiful gesture, but who knows?
She might be a drug addict.
We're not the kind of people that kill swans.
That's the kind of people.
We don't kill swans.
I had to tell her, larry.
Don't worry. She's not gonna say anything.
The two of you had better keep your goddamn traps shut about this swan.
What are you gonna do?
What will you do to me? and take every one of those hats and destroy 'em.
The blue hat, the orange hat, the one with the cockle shells, the one with the feathers, and let's not forget the red one you're making for that asshole stonemason.
You stop. You will not touch those hats.
Keep your goddamn mouth shut.
She will.
You're not gonna ruin a hat.
And you.
Larry, I'm not gonna tell anybody. Don't worry.
I was just saying
He's good.
He's good.
Yeah, I'm changing the headstone.
Great. Great.
What an asshole this guy is.
He butts in on a conversation that's none of his business, starts telling me how jeter's overrated.
What an ignorant moron.
Please, give me a break.
There's not one person who's ever said that except this asshole.
Who are you?
The stonemason. ah.
What are you doing here?
Did marty's mom's headstone and his dad's headstone.
I'm doing norm's headstone.
See you later, eddie.
What about your policy?
No introductions.
Exactly.
Hmm.
Look, he sent me this email.
Look at this.
He wants me to come clean about the swan. have your attention?
If you'll please take your seats, we're about to get started.
And where else?
His beloved club.
Norm loved nothing more than coming here and enjoying a leisurely game of golf.
Please turn off your cell phones and pagers.
May I tell you my theory?
Okay. I believe norm had the heart attack on the 12th hole near the pond, am I right?
I think he was attacked by the black swan.
The swan is dead, larry.
He's dead now.
He was very much alive at the time norm had the heart attack and at that pond with norm.
Here, the two of them over here.
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm on my way to the locker room.
I'm here.
I'm over here.
Here's norm and the swan.
Here's norm.
Kyoko the crazy black swan.
Norm. Heart attack. Down.
That's what happened.
That's why norm died.
That black swan was a menace.
They should've put that swan away a long time ago.
I don't know who killed that black swan, but whoever did it was a hero.
A hero.
Ah, Mr David,
I believe this is yours.
Yeah.
You can really just scroll right through those emails, huh?
Yeah.
There's no doubt that he read your email about the swan killing.
He's gonna tell takahashi.
We're screwed.
We're all screwed, there's no doubt about it.
This is as clear as can be.
I'll take care of this.
All right.
Great.
We'll see you.
Yeah, that's for real.
Yeah.
Yeah, like everything else.
Everything else.
Thank you again.
Really.
What a generous guy.
I don't think he knew what the fuck you were talking about.
He had the heart attack right by the pond. It was the swan.
Think about it.
It's a theory.
Anyway, it was a lovely service.
I'll see you at the club.
Larry, I'd like talk to you.
Yes, Mr Takahashi?
I heard about your big additional tip to waiter.
Such generosity.
You know, most people don't give additional tip.
Of course
I didn't kill kyoko.
I was trying to tell you that.
You forgive me?
Okay.
Lost a little face, didn't you?
I lost a lot of face. but it's on the way to the parking lot.
After you, sir.
After you.
I have a couple things I wanted to discuss with you actually.
Let's get rid of that additional tip in the dining room.
Nobody wants to sit and do math after they eat to figure out
Make it 25 percents.
Very much.
Last time you leave a big tip it always go to the waiter.
Okay.While Cheryl competes for a role on the Seinfeld reunion, Larry is forced by Jeff to embrace his feminine side after a series of bizarre events leads Suzie to think he's having an affair.
If sammi doesn't want to take clarinet anymore, she doesn't want to.
I'm having an allergy attack.
What is this?
What is this, jeff?
Whose panties are these?
It's your car. What are these doing in there?
All right, pull the fuck over.
Pull over.
I really hate shopping for pants.
I think those are gonna look great once they're hemmed.
All right.
It's the fire alarm.
Yeah, we need to leave.
But I left my pants in the dressing room.
Jesus.
Hey, what's going on?
Fire alarm.
Familiar with west side story?
By the way, they wanted to say fuck you.
He went to jail.
Okay.
How much longer?
If tech wants to get in there, it could be two hours.
Come here. Come here, shh.
I got in a lot of trouble with susie.
She found a pair of panties in my glove compartment.
Oy vey iz mir. Are you kidding me?
I told her they were your panties.
No no, I told her that they're your panties, that you like wearing women's panties.
I told her you like wearing women's panties.
Where the fuck did you come up with that? What does that mean?
I think it's pretty brilliant, actually.
You're gonna cover for me, right?
Please please please?
You're gonna cover for me?
They're your panties, right?
You don't have to really wear them.
You just know you've got them on and maybe you're a little more comfortable than normal.
Odd yet brilliant.
Completely and utterly brilliant.
My best one ever maybe.
You're a fucking friend.
Well, is the architecture not happening right now?
Hey, virginia, hi.
That's weird. Why?
Well, virginia, if you must know,
I was at banana republic and a fire alarm went off.
But you know what was amazing, when I was outside the store,
I was talking to an officer and his name was krupke. he'd never heard of the character from west side story.
Hey, larry, I'm auditioning for the reunion show, for the seinfeld reunion show tomorrow for the part of george's exwife.
Go ahead. I wanna hear.
I really have a hard time with how we met stories, okay?
I find it cloying and annoying.
Well, fine. I wanna hear it.
They were in the middle, I wanna hear it.
Why don't you go take a walk around the block, okay?
By the time you're back, they'll be finished.
Let me guess how it ends.
Hi, selling lemonade, huh?
Good for you. You're entrepreneurs.
Hey, mister, did you steal those pants?
An alarm went off in the store and I had to leave the store.
I mean, don't they want your pants back?
I have to bring them back and i'm going to, but I didn't steal.
A buck? Fine.
Thank you very much. Here you go.
I'm not even joking. Who made that?
Just get out of here if you don't like it.
Fine, I'll get out. It's terrible.
I'm gonna report you guys for that.
What are you looking at?
What? I'm not looking at anything.
I was not looking you over, paranoid.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you the gentleman who was just talking to my kids out there by the lemonade stand?
I think they deserve an adult critique.
The stand needs a little supervision, that's all I'm saying.
You know what? They're in that little kid bubble.
You know, just piss all over it.
I didn't piss on the buds.
No, I helped the buds.
I'm helping the buds grow.
You talk to my kids again, calling the cops.
You're auditioning?
Yeah.
For the same part, how strange.
Why would you have to audition? It's based on you.
Well, you know,
Larry was explaining it to me.
You know, actually, i'm meeting him for lunch later today.
Cheryl's here to read for amanda.
Well, I was in a store yesterday.
Why didn't you just wear your own pants today? cause then I'd have to carry these around.
Now I don't have to carry anything.
He wears the pants instead of carrying the pants.
Why hold a hat when you could just put it on your head?
Ready? Hello?
Honey, you couldn't call at a worse time. we're going through a really big storm right now.
Hold on, honey. What?
You need the warranty?
Honey, let me ask you a question do you know where the warranty card is on the tivo?
What did you say?
The tivo guy wants to know the name of the guy who installed this thing.
I don't know. I don't know his name.
You know what? The tivo guy's gonna go. back in 10 minutes, okay?
George. George. in here with you guys.
I knew she was good, never knew she was that good.
I mean, she was great.
That was a great audition.
I think we can close up shop, to tell you the truth.
Well, I think we should see everybody.
I know, but, you know, no one's gonna beat that.
I mean, it's really bad.
The tivo guy wants to know the name of the guy who installed this thing.
Ugh, I don't know. I don't know his name.
You know what? The tivo guy's gonna go. back in 10 minutes, okay?
George. virginia. Thank you.
I'm terrible at auditioning.
See you later. Great job.
I know probably you think it's hard for me to be objective here, but I thought cheryl was better.
I mean, this is cheryl, this part.
She was on that plane. She lived this part. That was her.
Who cares who was on the plane?
It's not a real plane. It's not a real show. It's not a real story.
You know, when we shoot this, they're gonna cut the plane in half.
It's not even gonna be a whole plane.
I believed cheryl more than I believed virginia.
Well, a girl like that, if you can get her, it's like let's get on board the virginia sloan, toot toot.
Next stop, comedy town.
I don't know what to tell you. We're at loggerheads here.
Mark?
Look, I think cheryl really set the bar at the time, but you cannot deny that that audition was outstanding.
I'd go with virginia.
Yeah.
That there's no chance of anything happening with you and cheryl.
You'll see. Don't worry, cheryl will be fine.
You're gonna be very happy.
All right, we'll go with virginia.
I remember you from the fire. cause I couldn't hang around till the store opened.
Well, how could I pay for the pants if you lost my pants?
That doesn't seem fair.
First of all, we didn't lose them. They're gone.
If they're lost, they'd be here in the lost and found.
They're gone and that's the difference.
No, if they were lost, they wouldn't be there.
They'd be lost, which they are.
Okay, we have a sign in the fitting room that says that we're not responsible for any lost items.
Good for you. I got a sign at my house, okay?
That doesn't exist. Nobody has a sign like that.
Of course I don't have a sign like that.
I just made it up for the purposes of this discussion.
It's not that unfathomable.
Okay, you have to replace my pants.
I'm not gonna pay for these pants.
It's like a scarlet letter.
I'm happy to wear the scarlet letter.
Really?
What are you doing? I thought you were gonna get your other pants.
What did everybody say about the audition?
But I don't know.
Jerry wants to give it to virginia.
I thought it was a done deal.
I know, but I'm glad that she got it if I didn't get it.
We actually all got together, dennis and virginia and me, and had lunch.
Got a little crazy, actually.
I mean, I was a little flattered.
I don't find that funny at all. Who does he think he is?
If you're gonna have a menage a trois with anybody, it's gonna be with me, not with him.
Why would I want to be in a menage a trois with you?
Well, you wouldn't. But if you're going to do it, i'd prefer that it would be with me, that's all.
Okay.
Yeah yeah.
Yes, it's more money.
It's a lot more money, but I can do it for you.
Hang on. Yeah.
Look, I'll meet you in 20 minutes, all right?
Right there at the site.
Hi, larry, what's up?
You don't need to concern yourself with the difference, okay?
All right, fine.
I would not be defiling her.
Whatever two people do, or three people do, in the privacy of their own homes is their own business.
Yeah, I've heard that bullshit.
She's not interested in doing anything in the privacy of your home, okay?
That remains to be seen.
What does that mean?
Larry, just because cheryl is curious doesn't mean you have any right to get mad at me, okay?
What do you mean nothing?
What's all this fidget?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your underwear.
I have a little problem with my underwear.
All of a sudden out of nowhere?
Really? Where'd you buy them?
That's a load of shit. You don't know how to use a computer.
Clearly she is not believing a word of this.
I watched the whole thing. What are you doing?
It's a comfort thing. Don't add a transvestite level to this.
No, you're crazy. He wants comfort.
You're comfortable, that's it.
You're larry david and you like comfort in women's panties, all right?
Stop overacting, just keep it on the down, okay?
Come on. All right?
You're larry david. Who are you?
Listen, I got big fucking news.
Huge. You ready for this?
I got a call from virginia.
She can't do the part.
She's in a neck brace.
She wouldn't tell me.
I said, what happened? and she said, it's not important.
If it wasn't a car accident, she injured her neck going down on cheryl.
It could've been a car accident. You don't know.
Let's check her car.
All right, let's check her car.
And what do you happen to enjoy?
Hey.
What are you, an idiot?
See anything?
I don't see any damage at all.
Nothing.
Virginia can't do the part.
You're playing george's exwife.
I'm gonna play george's exwife?
Are you kidding me?
Tell all your family.
Tell them all, yeah.
That's unbelievable. Thank you.
Why can't she do it?
What an interesting question.
Why can't she do it?
It seems as if virginia hurt her neck.
Very good, very good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
One is a car accident.
And she was not in a car accident because I checked the car.
Listen, we're adults.
Because I told you about
She's gonna leave me.
She's gonna leave me, man.
She still thinks the panties are mine.
I'll be right there.
Come on, man, I need your help.
Okay, you know what? I have an idea.
What a jerk.
It's a good plan, but it's just gotta be natural.
Virginia got in a really bad car accident.
She didn't get in car accident, okay?
I saw her car. There's not a scratch on it.
No, she did, larry, okay?
She was driving dennis's fucked up. Who's that?
I'm looking for larry david.
We received a call about you using obscenities against a woman and her children.
What? That's ridiculous.
I didn't say fuck you. I said krup you.
Krup you.
Where'd you get those pants?
Banana republic.
There's a security tag on those pants.
I don't care. Okay, here.
Who are you?
I'm larry david. I happen to enjoy wearing women's panties.
You gotta tell susie I was in a car accident. ? Gee, officer krupke, we're very upset ?Rehearsals for the Seinfeld reunion show get complicated when Larry's text message exchange with a 9 year old Seinfeld fan lands him in trouble with the local authorities. Meanwhile, Leon tries to fool Michael Richards.
Larry, it's exactly the same.
Exactly the same.
Yeah, she acts.
It's great.
What has she done?
I don't know exactly.
Hey, Larry.
I want you to meet my daughter, Emma.
How come you don't have red hair like your mum?
My dad is blonde.
She's been dying to meet you.
Allright, nice to meet you.
Yes, sure.
Really?
I'm gonna get the table read started, okay?
Good luck.
Look at you, this is very strong, this is good stuff.
I'm thrilled, thrilled.
What are you calling her, Cheryl?
Is that the character's name, Cheryl?
I got confused 'cos on the chair it says Cheryl David.
I understand, yeah.
Well, I don't know, she auditioned.
Did she really? I wish I'd seen that.
And she was the best.
Really? Well, that's good.
Who was the next best?
Don't know.
Don't remember.
I thought we were gonna stay and dialogue it.
I would've stay and dialogue, had you called me to dialogue.
You're the executive producer.
Right, and generally the executive producer doesn't call the minion.
The minion would call the executive producer.
Fortunately, it all worked out for the best.
I want just to take a few notes.
You return it.
No, I'm gonna keep it. Of course I'm gonna return it.
What's the matter?
Hey, you know what?
Don't worry about it. Honest to God.
I know this accountant, Danny
You know what? I'll have him call you, how 'bout that?
Listen, you're gonna be fine.
I'll have Duberstein call you.
I don't need support.
You can't just show up like that.
You're not allowed to be here, the only people from the show is supposed to be here.
Ask him. If he tells me to go, I'll go.
I don't care, doesn't bother me.
Wanna hear a joke?
He doesn't want to hear a joke, we got a read through.
Let me just get right through it.
I'm surprised I didn't wake you up.
Okay, you told the joke, let's go.
I had no idea it would be that revolting.
Okay, let sit us at the table.
Go sit in the bleacher.  I like that guy.
He's crazy.
Hey.
Don't worry. You're going to be great.
It's nothing. Come on.
Look how many people are here.
Okay, folks, please settle in.
We're looking at the reunion, written by Larry david and Jerry seinfeld.
Scene a opens in Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George.
No one knows. That's why it's unwritten.
You don't blow your nose in a cloth napkin in a restaurant. why? They wash it.
You have 2.5 seconds before the bomb goes off. my rules, not your rules.
I can't figure out why she left you.
Hey, George, did you see this?
It's an article about bernie Madoff.
They got the floor plan of all his offices.
No, you couldn't get to him.
It was a ponzi scheme.
Do I need this? I know what happened.
It was more than a couple.
Well, it was more than a great idea.
An iphone application that leads you via your gps to the nearest acceptable toilet wherever you are in the world.
The itoilet. And I thought of it.
Why'd you have to give that crook Madoff all of it? all of it, Jerry. scene b, we're in Jerry's apartment. It's later.
Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer.
Jerr, can you do me a favor and babysit tonight?
I figured you were busy. kids. I don't condescend to them.
Jerry, hey, did you give isabel's doll a haircut?
Children need consistency.
I can make that happen.
I think uncle Jerry should do it, which is what she's calling you, by the way.
Well, because I donated the sperm.
I offered.
I would have bought you a new house.
That's easy to say now after you lost everything.
Hey, Jerry, this economy is really hitting me.
It's all dried up out there.
It's dry, Jerry, dry as a bone.
You weren't working in the good economy.
Yeah, I guess that's true. h. It's in the coffee shop.
This is day 4. George, Amanda.
Tell you about the whole Madoff thing.
Actually, i'm fine, George. right after we got divorced.
Turns out I did quite well by him.
Collar up?
Creeped you out? That's my money.
You have my money.
Not according to the laws of the state of new york.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
And it's none of your business, Elaine.
George takes out a napkin and brings it to his nose. the shot freezes and we fade out.
Please take five.
We're in Jerry's apartment in five.
Eh, you know what? Great.
Yeah. Thank you very much, by the way.
I appreciate the loan of your pen.
You know what? You keep it.
I don't want the pen.
I don't want the pen. I just needed to borrow it for a couple of minutes.
What's wrong with the pen?
I was watching you
In my ear? What are you talking about?
It was in every orifice of your body.
I had the pen up my ass
I'm here to serve you. What can I do?
Why don't you get me a new pen? That would be nice.
That's the fair thing to do, the nice thing to do, the right thing to do.
Wow, this place is packed.
Two for lunch? oul? just follow me.
Best waiter? A table right away?
What the hell's going on?
I give it to him all the time. what's this?
Stacy's daughter just sent me a text. got your info from my mom. Nice meeting you.
Did you have fun at the table read? you got a new little pen pal.
I guess I have to answer her.
She asked me a question, right?
You don't have to. It's a little kid.
Just say, hey, went great, thanks. went great, thanks.
He thinks he might have groat's disease?
Yeah, and I told him that I'd hook him up with Funkhouser's friend Danny Duberstein.
Nobody can get in touch with him.
He died like two months ago.
Duberstein died?
Jesus. What the hell am
I going to tell michael?
I don't know.
What did you think of that Kramer thing with the latch for the toilet, the itoilet?
I don't remember if that worked or not.
What about Julia and the kid with the present?
It kind of worked. no?
Did you hear any of the jokes?
Where was your mind at?
First he was scratching his back with it.
Scratching a back is no big deal.
You know, I like to keep my pens in a barbicide.
Stacy's daughter Emma. Did you meet her?
Come on, who needs this?
She's getting on my nerves.
How do I end this thing?
This is never going to end.
No, it will never end.
That's why I don't have one.
I really think we're going to need a fourth camera for the exteriors.
Okay, I'll get right on it.
You know, Emma's been texting me.
How'd that happen?
Was that her idea, your idea? yeah, it was her idea. I mean, yeah.
You know, when you're a kid and
Maybe you should give her Jerry's.
Maybe if she meets Jerry, but she really bonded with you.
Yeah, she seemed to respond to you.
How's her pussy, by the way? actually. It's not as itchy.
Yeah, all right, I'm going to get on the camera thing.
We had a deal.
When you came to me, you said, I need a donation.
And I gave, and that was hard work. be, uncle Jerry your whole life?
I just think it would be nice if she knew who her father was.
Clark kent didn't know who his father was till he was 16 and he turned out pretty good.
Jerry, his planet was destroyed.
I think I continue.
Isabel's not going to have any of those crystals.
You know about the crystals?
Of course I know about the crystals. door.
I wonder if you would tell your friend George that on my route I had occasion to use
All right, you watch the show.
Well, I'm afraid in that particular scenario, my sympathies lie only with the toilet.
I'm going to the ballgame.
I take monena with me, I can use the carpool lane.
I see.
You should just go in and make yourself at home.
Okay, guys, take five.
That's a tight five.
We're back in Jerry's apartment.
How long ago did you leave the message? but I can hardly think out here.
You know what the doctor said to me?
I'm supposed to stand by for the symptoms.
I'm having a bit of a problem just trying to find a tone.
They have a cadence.
Like, yeah, I still have my half.
You don't need a cadence. Just be yourself. You're doing great.
Don't feel the seinfeldian pressure.
It's not the pen I gave you.
This is not replacing the pen.
This is just giving me another pen.
You didn't say, get the same pen.
You said, you need to replace the pen.
It's not an eye for a lesser eye, okay?
It's an eye for an eye, not an eye that doesn't see very well.
Using your metaphor, no no.
They both see exactly the same.
That pen that I have in my possession
This pen writes in blue ink exactly the same. It's the same eye.
This pen is almost blind compared to my pen.
No, believe me. It sees the truth.
It's not the pen I gave you.
You asked me to replace the pen.
I'm going to get a coffee.
Anyway, I screwed the whole thing up.
Michael thinks that
What, you think I can't do this shit, huh?
I'll white that shit up.
I'll white that whole shit up.
You've seen a fucking black dude who acts fucking white. how are you doing today?
I'm Danny Duberstein.
I heard you have groat's disease. see that shit?
Well, what about the name? Duberstein?
If we're gonna do this, you'd better learn how to pronounce this. bar mitzfit.
Another text from her.
Can you believe it? and she keeps texting me.
Is Jerry as funny in real life as on tv? unbelievable. yes, Jerry is very funny.
I'm telling you, it never ends with her.
All right, I'm going to get this.
He took my $20. Are you kidding?
He took your fucking money out your hand?
What did he think? I was tipping him?
Is he insane? do you watch 'wizards of waverly place'?
All right, that's it. That's it. no, I don't watch wizards of waverly place. why would you do that, Larry?
You texted her with all caps and a lot of exclamations points.
No, I was being emphatic.
I wasn't yelling.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking maybe I can get her to stop texting me.
Larry, I need you to make this right, okay?
Okay, i'll make it right.
I want you to be there, pretend like it was your idea, okay?
I think it would be really nice if you took her out to lunch. how many with you for lunch?
You look wonderful. Very fit.
Always wonderful. Bon app?tit.
Thank you, thank you.
If you need anything, call me.
Are you unhappy with the table?
Okay, I see your problem here.
Yesterday at the newsstand, you took $20 out of my hand.
The wonderful service, the dinner.
I already paid you for that service.
Well, what were you giving it to me for?
What was the $20 doing in my hand?
Because I was using it to pay for a magazine. Can't you understand that?
I gave you $20 yesterday and you're not getting another penny out of me, okay?
For the text I sent you with all the capital letters, the bad bad caps.
Just because you say it doesn't mean you mean it.
Larry, do you remember when you were a little boy?
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.
Obviously they're ignoring me on purpose. why?
This little girl, she's got an appointment with the doctor.
She's got a rash on her pussy.
It's been three years.
Danny Duberstein, CPA.
Come in, I want to talk to you.
Is Larry here yet?
I'm waiting for Larry.
No, I got to talk to you.
This is very important.
You know what?
Yay, Larry, that was thoughtful.
I love it. Okay.
The last time was a few months ago in atlantic city.
But I thought you only got bar mitzvahed once.
You know, when you're 13 years old?
It's once every 13 years, you know.
I don't know.
Well, everything I ate tasted like peaches.
And I forgot how to multiply.
I could subtract, but
I couldn't multiply.
If I'm fucking six women three times a day, seven days a week, how many times per week am I fucking?
Was it 10? Was it 130?
Was it 16? I was tripping out.
Pssh, you're telling me. that's math and fucking.
But how did you beat the groat's?
You know what?
This hat.
This hat saved my life.
Look who the fuck shows up. What happened?
You missed the whole fucking show.
I'm in that fucking room busting my ass for you.
What's with these suits?
You look like farrakhan.
Look, I was trying to fuck this muslim girl. I had to join up for a month.
Accountants don't look like this.
This the whitest shit I got right here.
What the fuck you think happened in there?
I went in that room and whited that shit the fuck up.
I had that fucking dude rolling with me.
That goofy motherfucking man in that room will survive that shit.
Let me tell you how fucking well he bought it.
He's going to give me $200,000 to invest for his ass.
I Danny Dubersteined the fuck out that man in that room.
Fucking viola. uh.
Elaine, clark kent didn't know who his real father was until he was 16, and I think he turned out okay.
Jerry, his planet was destroyed.
Who are these two right here?
What is it? You never saw the show?
You never watched it?
Who is this little fat bastard?
Now that little motherfucker look funny.
Christ, I'm itching all over.
Hope I didn't catch anything from that Emma.
Don't get that shit on me, man.
Hey, are you monena?
You know it.
I take monena with me, I can use the carpool lane.
It's my hat.
I told him to wear the hat to combat the groat's.
What did you say to him?
I told him, you take that hat off, you will die.
That's what I told him.
See you at the house, man.
Nobody remembers a guy with a dinner roll on his head.
They remember Kramer with the hair that goes up.
What? Again? Why are you here?
It is an honor to meet you.
My husband has been dead for two months.
Yeah, it was a long, painful death.
Larry. Larry.
Larry.
I know I may look clean and dapper right now.
Bet the suit threw you, baby. yeah yeah, i'm talking to you.
What kind of lowlife are you?
Okay okay, let's just calm down now.
No, don't baby me. Don't calm me down.
A horrible name that I could call you that would make you as angry as I am.
First it was on my back, now my neck and my arm.
Now it's on my hands and fingers.
Do you have any idea how you may have gotten this rash?
Yeah, that's her now.
We'll get you taken care of.
I have another patient to check on. don't tell your mother, but I bought you another pen.
Call the police.
You must hate me for losing all our money.
Look at me. I'm living with jerry.
We're wiped out.
Actually, I'm fine, george.
Fine?
I took my half out of madoff right after we got divorced.
Wait a second.
It's good. Keep going.
You have my money.
Not according to the laws of the state of new york.
Okay, jeez.
Forgot to go to the cash machine.
We're right back here tomorrow.
That's a wrap.
That was great. Really funny.
I don't know. Was the pace of that right?
It was really good.
It's really good. It's really good.
I'm done. I'm gonna go talk to the prop guy.
The glasses are a little off.
I'm being honest. You were fantastic.
I am not fantastic.
You are. And they like you.
Julia likes you. They all like you. Michael.
I like you.
It's like you're the man, you know?
Yeah.
Sure, yeah.
What about after julia's book party for jason?
Definitely.
What's with the tinted windows?
I think he likes his privacy.
What is he, george clooney? I mean, come on.
Boy, you know a lot about this guy.
We spend a lot of time together just talking about nothing between takes.
You have the best vanilla decaf latte.
Hey, where you going with this?
I was going over to the production office.
I'll talk to you later. Thanks for the compliment about the coffee.
All right, I'll see you in a little while.
I really like your hair like that.
I think you should make a move tonight.
I can't. Whenever I make a move
Because I'm thinking about it, my conversation gets very stilted.
She invited you. You must make a move.
You realize all your dreams are coming true?
I love the face. Don't you love the face?
The let's cut the crap, you know?
Kind of on the thin side, isn't it?
Raise your kids without raising them.
You know what else is kind of annoying?
Have you noticed people are saying, having said that
A comedian goes up on stage, you people are a bunch of morons.
Having said that, i'm very happy to be here.
Hey, I talked to your buddy mocha joe a minute ago.
Boy, it takes a lot to get a tip out of that guy.
I asked him to do me a favor.
I didn't say I want to hire you.
A tip is money for a favor.
How are you? Nice to see you.
You're really cutting the figure these days.
Well, thank you very much.
Yet it's very concise.
Yeah, I tried to get it down to the essentials.
Yeah, I'll read it with dinner.
Yeah, what does acting without acting mean?
It just means you don't want to see the actor at work.
Having said that, I think this is a terrific title.
It is without acting.
It's hiding the acting.
Earlier? You were?
Has it ever occurred to you to use a coaster?
I am a little bit freaked out because you need to know this table has been in for generations, okay? And look at it.
Yeah, but I didn't put my glass down there.
Yeah, I know, but the glass never left my hand.
I always hold onto my glass.
It makes me feel comfortable and secure and I don't have to shake hands.
I don't know who any of these people are in my house, by the way.
Where is he? Which friend?
Well, look it, you say you would never put a wet glass down on an antique wooden table.
Having said that,
Mocha joe, I asked you to do me a favor.
If you asked me to do you a favor I would say yes.
I wouldn't expect any money in return.
You do me a favor and we're even. to stern bros. Coffee and pick up my coffee order for tomorrow.
Mocha joe, that's insane.
Hollywood is the exact opposite direction of where I live.
You know what, larry? If you don't do the favor, we got nothing to talk about.
I was completely wrong about not tipping you.
No, you said you would do me the favor.
No going back in time.
You said you would do me a favor. Now do me a favor.
Okay, mocha joe.
I'll go to hollywood.
I'll pick up your beans, okay?
Here's the card for stern bros. Coffee, west hollywood.
Pick up that coffee for me.
Bring it to the studio tomorrow.
See you tomorrow, larry.
I hardly got a chance to talk to you.
What? We're working.
We are. We're working together.
God damn it.
I think I'm gonna be late.
I'm in bad traffic.
Okay. i'll see you tomorrow. all right. See you tomorrow.
Yeah. Yeah, she's good.
Easy to work with. We got together last night at her place. pick one out.
Hey, lar. lar.
The guy came, I got an estimate and it's gonna cost 500 bucks to fix that table.
The ring.
Come on, man. Yes you did.
Please don't play this game with me.
I would tell you if I left it.
I respect wood. I revere wood.
I'm considerate of wood.
Lar, I have known you since 1983.
I know when you are lying.
Really?
Seriously?
I don't even care about the money, larry.
Just fess up, man.
We're in jerry's apartment.
It's george and amanda.
We're right here.
And we were talking about you and the therapist says that maybe there's another side to you.
How about that? How about that?
I know, but I don't say I made it.
I'm playing george.
But it says that they fight over the popcorn.
You're fighting with your hands, okay?
This is like the greatest relationship
I've ever seen you have on the show.
I know, george has never been this happy.
I'm watching richard benjamin and paula prentiss here.
Okay, that's lunch for a half.
We're feeding on 19. We're right back here after lunch.
Don't change anything though.
Did you get a chance to pick up those beans? I'm really low on coffee.
You know, I went and there was a lot of traffic.
I attempted to do you the favor.
I tried to do you the favor.
What are you talking about?
It is a favor. It is a favor.
That's as good as a favor.
Well, the store was closed.
Driving to a coffee place is not a favor.
Mocha joe has nothing to show for your supposed favor.
Come on, I did a lot for mocha joe.
Mocha joe doesn't need people driving around for him.
E for effort. You people think about that.
E for effort.
F for favor.
C for coffee. outside they went to lunch in his car with the tinted windows.
Who knows what's going on with those tinted windows?
Anything could be going on in that car.
They could be eating burritos behind those tinted windows at lunch.
That's your proof?
They've got tinted windows?
It's not only that. I told you what happened on stage.
The way they were getting along and laughing and the touching and all that.
And last night he was at her house.
You didn't see them. If you had seen them you wouldn't say that.
I think you should just let this blow over.
This is nothing. And just go back to work.
Come on. I'll see you later.
All right. oh. you got a ring stain on your table.
What? What's interesting about a ring stain?
Wait a second. had a drink at the party.
I notice you got a little ring stain on your table.
I know. I noticed that.
You've demonstrated a consistent lack or respect for wood as I see it.
I don't know what you're getting at. I don't know what this is about.
I'll tell you what I'm getting at.
I remember you standing over julia's antique table with a drink.
Okay.
Don't touch my books. Get out.
Get the fuck out.
I got them tinted.
I'm telling you, it makes a big difference with the sun.
What do you mean?
I was supposed to come over.
You told me not to come and you wound up working with jason.
Well, you said you were busy with your beans,
I wasn't busy with any beans.
I was picking beans up.
I wasn't busy with them.
That's busy.
I said the phrase busy with beans? I don't think so.
You want to think I was busy with beans, go ahead and think that.
I want to know how he wound up there.
Did he call you? Did you call him?
I'm curious.
This is all your fault, mocha joe.
I'm not gonna forget this, mocha joe.
You still owe me a favor, larry.
Yeah, I'll bring you breakfast in bed tomorrow.
Yeah, good. I'll be hungry.
And we were talking about you and the therapist says that maybe there's another side to you.
Yeah, not just one. Dozens.
Should we sit down?
Okay, you know what? I have an idea.
I think we should change the blocking. Come here for a second.
I want you over here on the stool.
You know what? Forget the stool. Come here.
Here's what we're gonna do. Yeah, come here. you stay here. You're gonna do the scene in there.
I want to see them get together.
Did you get that? I thought this was working.
I don't get this idea. This doesn't make any sense at all.
Why? It's kind of quirky that he's saying this stuff from the bathroom.
Who else would do that?
How many years did we work together?
Everything's fine.
You're sure?
Yeah.
Completely sure?
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, let's go to that thal joint we used to go to.
Remember you used to get that pad thal with the noodles?
Where's cheryl?
She left with jason.
Hey, did you see cheryl?
She went that way.
Cheryl. aha. no.
They're going to destroy the dogs now because mocha joe was bitten. and ask him to just drop the charges.
Why are you going through his car, by the way?
Isn't that a little suspicious?
Well, I'm thinking about buying one of those and I wanted to check out the headroom.
Then you go to a showroom.
Go to a car dealer and check it out. Talk to a salesman.
Look, the point is you can't let the dogs die.
Okay fine, i'll go talk to mocha joe.
But you know what? It's not gonna make a difference.
He doesn't want to talk to me.
I'm gonna start to work on this a scene.
See if we can get a better opening.
What is this?
Looks like a stain from coffee.
Really?
Let me ask you a question.
How did this get here?
I guess you could say that.
I respect all wood. I respect pine.
I respect walnut. I respect oak.
Doesn't matter, okay? You don't.
And what about the dogs?
No respect for the dogs?
Did you leave that stain on her coffee table, jerry?
You've lost your mind.
Okay.
The thing is, mocha joe, if you press charges those dogs are gonna get put down.
That's right, larry. Those dogs are getting gassed.
I'd do it myself if I could.
And I'd have it televised.
Does this favor involve a tip?
Okay, mocha joe.
I guess it does.
That's for not picking up my fucking coffee beans.
I went down there, but the store was closed.
Not my fault.
One dog lives.
Right, a black coffee no sugar and one vanilla decaf latte.
The dogs, okay? Are we good?
Stay of execution.
How you doing, ladies?
Hey, cheryl, what's going on in there?
Cheryl, open up.
Larry, hey. that's right. I see you. scampering and scurrying, I see you.
Larry, what are you doing?
Well, you're intimidating him.
That's george. That's all george. That's me.
I wrote that stuff. You're not attracted to him, you're attracted to me.
I'm george.
Did you work on this with him?
It's all bullshit. What couples get together in the end?
Larry, we already screwed up one finale. We can't do another.
We didn't screw up a finale.
That was a good finale.
I was very invested in that story.
That story had a great ending.
This is a whole different thing.
Well, this is the show. This is the show.
You know what? I'm not comfortable with that.
Larry, do what you want to do.
I quit, thank you very much.
It's just a script, larry.
There's no show without jason.
I don't know. We're not doing anything.
Larry, what do you want to do?
I'll play george. yes, I can do it.
You'll play what, george's butler? What do you mean?
No, I will play george costanza.
I can do it. I know I can.
I wrote it. The character is based on me.
There were two darrens on bewitched.
Nobody liked that second darren.
It's iconic television here.
The set's an icon. He's an icon.
She's an icon. He was an icon.
It's not what they want.
What are we gonna do?
Let me try it. Let me try it.
Let me do one scene.
What have you got to lose?
What is with the blackberry people?
Can I just pick up a magazine, hold in front of your face and read it while you're talking? Is that okay too?
Wait, what magazine?
Hey, george.
Are you happy?
I want to know if you're happy.
You had to interfere, didn't you?
George, what are you talking about?
George, wouldn't it be easier just to talk to amanda?
No. No.
George is getting upset.
Yeah, I just quit. I did.
I tried to do george and they didn't like it.
You know what? Let them do their stupid ending with jason.
He's already on his way back here.
I don't care.
Well, you know what?
But if I can't have her, what's the point?
I'm quitting.
But man wants to make his woman happy.
Wants to do it.
Can't do nothing.
Woman says, i can't believe you're doing this. man says, doing what? woman starts crying.
Man says, i didn't do anything. woman says, exactly. it's an unwritten rule of etiquette, george.
That's why it's unwritten.
You do not blow your nose into a cloth napkin in a restaurant. why? They wash it.
Even the impolite don't do it.
The other day you sneezed into a napkin.
A sneeze is involuntary.
You have 2.5 seconds before that bomb goes off.
Well, I live by my rules.
I don't live by your rules.
Can't figure out why she left you.
Hey, george.
Did you see this?
Look at this. They got the floor plan to all his offices.
You couldn't get to him.
It was a ponzi scheme.
All right, do I need to hear this?
It was more than a couple.
Well, it was more than a great idea.
An iphone application that
To the nearest acceptable toilet wherever you are in the world.
The itoilet.
And I thought of it.
That was one killer app.
Why'd you have to give it all to that crook madoff?
I don't know.
How could you be so fiscally irresponsible?
All of it, jerry. All of it.
Well, I'll never meet anyone else again.
Probably not.
This is what single people are thinking about the minute they wake up in the morning.
And yet we're surrounded by people.
They're right next to us on the bus, on the street.
Because strangers have a bad reputation.
A few bad strangers that ruined it for the rest of us.
Oh. how are you?
Dating?
Just sex.
I know.
I quit.
You quit?
Well, you know, virginia's neck got better.
She should have had the part. She was originally cast.
And I got in a big fight with jason.
You called his book a pamphlet?
It's not a book. I know it's not a book.
No, it's not a book.
It just, I don't know.
I'm watching the show. Come on in.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what?
I have to call my mother in florida and tell her we're back together.
This could be the news that finally kills her.
Because of the shock or because she doesn't like me? i'm fine either way.
What do I say if she asks me why?
That's how I feel about cuban food.
When I'm eating it I don't really like it.
When I'm away for a little while I Miss it.
George and amanda are getting back together.
George couldn't make it on the outside.
He doesn't have the tools.
Hey, thanks for getting that doll for isabelle.
Did she comment on the fact that her doll is now black?
Didn't say a word except, tell daddy thank you.
Daddy.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
And you know what?
Yeah, because they belong together.
Really?
Don't you think?
Are you sure?
A ring stain?
I have a bad habit of just putting my drink down on the table.
A bad habit? You just put your drink down on the wood.
Look at that stain you made. This is a new table.
Do you respect wood?
You guess so?
You don't know if you respect wood?
I never thought about it before.
You had a cup like that at julia's party.
You were standing right by that table.
You left the ring stain on julia's table.
She blamed me the whole time, but it was you.
Well, it's no big deal.
You're right.
You're right, it is no big deal.
Having said that,
I would love for you to call julia and tell her
Yeah, just tell her that you were the one who left the stain on the antique table.
I have a bad habit of just putting my drink down on the table.
Bad habit?
Put your drink down on the wood?
Do you respect wood?
You had a cup like that at Julia's party.
You left the ring stain on Julia's table.
She blamed me the whole time, but it was you.
It is no big deal.
Having said that,
I would love for you to call Julia and tell her you left the ring stain.
That you were the one who left the stain on the antique table.
I'm not talking to Julia.
I said no and you don't listen to me.
Hold on, okay.
Cheryl, wait one second. No no, I think she left the ring stain. Hold on.
Yeah.
Cheryl.
Cheryl. but this is a fantastic deal.
It's not only the best deal
I'm gonna get for you, it's the best deal that anybody's gonna get for anybody.
Yore gonna keep your house, you're keeping all your property.
You know?
I know that's important to you.
You're coming out ahead in this deal and she's coming out behind.
Imagine like a Dutch apple pie, right?
The filling, the real meat of the pie, is everything you're getting.
She's just getting the appearance.
No, everybody does.
Yeah, it's delicious.
I like that more than the pie.
I would rather get that
That's a part of it, a pie without the filling.
She's getting the filling and you're
It's a good deal.
It's ready to be signed.
Everything's going to be fine, Larry.
You came to the right place.
You know what, Berg?
I appreciate that.
Cheryl and her lawyer are going to be here in a matter of minutes.
You don't have to, but it might not be a bad idea for you to stick around for that meeting.
It'd be a good desk to get blowjobs under.
That's not why I bought it, but let's call it a happy accident.
I'm gonna leave it in your hands.
I trust you. my attorney.
This is Larry David.
I didn't really go after a bald man.
You know, you should've recused yourself.
We can't go up against each other.
I'm giving her the bedding. See?
And the pillows.
I'm giving you all those pillows. you don't like those pillows either.
I know, but I could charge you for them if I wasn't being fair.
Technically.
Correct, okay?
And I can call you bald.
It's like black people calling each other nigga.
You know, for dating. I'm just wondering if she'll point it out, that's all.
And that's what you do on your dates?
If he was doing it on purpose, I would think he was an asshole.
Only because I told you because you know who I am.
But if you didn't know me and we had just met, and then all of a sudden you're sitting
Okay, that doesn't work.
I don't think you should do that.
Nice meeting you.
You take whatever 50 percents you want.
I'll take what's left.
No arguing,
You think we're gonna have a nice divorce if we ever get divorced?
No fucking way. I'm taking you for everything you have, mister.
You're gonna get nothing out of it.
You mention the d word once in your fucking life, you'll rue the day you ever met me.
It's really beautiful this time of year.
No, it's cold. Right now it's cold and foggy and dangerous.
They have gangs over there and everything else and I'll be doing business.
I never travel with you.
I think it's a great idea. I'm going.
That's decided.
I didn't want to interrupt.
Did you speak to Andy today?
You know, it's complicated to say the least.
The team's an asset and it's kind of a little precarious right now.
I think he'll come through for us though.
I'm pretty confident.
Would you be interested in coming out, sitting in a box with me? discuss why the hell we got married in the first place.
Yeah, I'd be interested. to be knocking on your doors possibly.
I'll be slamming the door in her face.
I hope that doesn't bother you.
She's coming.
Be prepared.
No, two's plenty.
Because then he's eating it.
It's all he can eat also.
I wasn't going to make a second visit.
This is it. This is my only plate.
Excuse me, maybe I can help.
Hello, I'm Hiriam Katz,
Maybe I can straighten this out.
And secondly, if you suspect that he's stealing another buffet from you, you'd have to be able to establish prior intent.
Now can you prove prior tent?
Hmm?
I'd be happy to get you a round of drinks.
Apology accepted.
That won't be necessary.
I hope you don't mind.
I am Hiriam Katz,
Here's my card.
Enjoy your brunch.
Hey, how about O'Donnell inviting me to sit in his box?
Excuse me?
I got plenty of hookups, Larry.
You don't see them.
You don't notice the small shit, Larry.
What small shit?
There hasn't been any small things.
Hi, is this
We he the Tagalongs.
You know what?
I'm not even interested.
Give me five boxes of each of them.
All right.
Now you see, these Samoas, that looks pretty good actually.
It's covered with caramel, rolled in toasted coconut.
Cause I'm a huge coconut guy.
Everything okay?
Okay.
That's no problem at all.
You know why? In fact,
I got an exwife and I was married and she's a woman.
She left stuff upstairs that's going to be very valuable to you.
I'm going to run up and get it.
You stay right here. Don't move.
Okay, don't worry.
You had it in the right place.
I'm not kidding.
I got this. I got this.
Stay right there.
I'll be right down.
Okay, got it.
Here you go, all right.
Okay okay.
If you're using a tampon, you'll see that the plastic applicator is made of two tubes.
I don't know what this is.
Gently slide the applicator
How do I know if I'm doing it right?
I've never used one of these and
I got it.
I got it.
Look, it pushes it out.
Listen to me.
Take the inside where the string is
Push it.
Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
Put the outer tube in your vagina. doing. I've never done this before.
Look, it came out of the plastic.
I'm holding it.
I think so.
I think I got it.
All right. on Bundy and San Vicente, guy pulls up next to me on a motorcycle,
Yeah. What is a Jew doing on a motorcycle?
It's young Larry with the big 'fro.
Right, it's 'fro Larry.
Well, good afternoon, General Petrus.
It's lovely to see you.
This happens to be very in.
You better go over to
O'Donnell and apologize.
If her nose is running and she needed a tissue,
I would have given her a tissue.
Same thing.
No, not the same thing.
It's inappropriate.
It's his issue.
I'm just the messenger.
Don't kill the messenger, as they say.
Well, look who's here.
It's the big funk.
You are a colossal prick.
You ruined my whole vacation.
You had to butt in and tell Nan to go on my trip. working and being alone.
I was curious as to why she wasn't going.
Why don't you just go with her?
Why don't you bring her?
I'm bored. Everywhere I go with her we don't look at each other, she talks over me.
I want to be alone.
I want to get the chance to spread my wings.
Coming.
Yes, may I help you?
I'm here to see
Mr O'Donnell. but he give me special instruction not to open the door for you.
What?
Wait a second.
What do you mean he doesn't want to see me? Why?
I didn't do anything bad to miss Kyra.
I close door. Mr O'Donnell say,
Larry David, close door on him.
What? Hold it.
Wait a second.
I'm supposed to go to the baseball game with him. and I said I'd be very interested.
Interested doesn't mean ticket.
Yeah, interested means ticket.
I'm interested,
I have no ticket.
Gardener interested, chauffer interested,
Cook more interested than me, he has no ticket.
What?
Put those back.
You don't even know what they are.
Do you know what they are?
I don't care. You're not coming up here and stealing those.
To me, it's kind of like public school.
You went to school, you got through it
I wouldn't be tongue scraping if it wasn't for you.
Do you think there's any chance we could have sex?
What's the difference?
Honestly, think about it, what's the difference?
Let's just do it. Come on.
What have I done?
Name one thing I've done that makes you think I want to have sex with you.
Yes, you're talking to me. it seems crazy if
I don't at least offer.
Andrew Berg went to high school with Julie at St. Christopher's.
Wait a second.
How could Andrew Berg go to St. Christopher's?
Isn't that a catholic school?
First of all, I commend you on the demographics.
Thank you.
Are you a Jew perchance? wonderful.
I no longer want them.
But Kyra said you were interested in buying them.
I was interested and now, as a result of some difficulties with her father,
You go talk to Joe O'Donnell.
Ask him why there's not going to be any cookies.
Jerk.
Hey, look who's here.
I was talking to Cheryl and she told me that a friend of hers went to high school with you.
That is my alma mater, yes.
I mean, why would they?
Mazel tov, Larry.
Well, you're Jewish.
It's only respectful.
Right, like, I'm a Jew, but not a practicing Jew.
A shofar.
Why is this on your desk?
People give me gifts. or the mezuzah that's on the door.
I got a Swede lawyer?
She's gonna get everything.
You got a good lawyer.
You got the best lawyer, Larry.
I thought he was Jewish.
He seemed Jewish.
When he first met me, he called me a big macher.
And then he'd call me maybe once a month and ask me if I wanted to go for a nosh.
Come on, let's go for a nosh.
It'll be good.
I'll tell you one thing, I'm not signing any papers until I get a new lawyer.
Guess who's getting a divorce.
She said okay.
I'm gonna be single.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
You know what you do when you get a fucking divorce?
You ran that ass in the ground and you're moving on, right? nice marriage for 20 years.
It's not a negative thing to run an ass in the ground. That's all. getting a chance to get divorced except me.
You get divorced, you get divorced, you don't even need to get divorced.
Even the owner of the Dodgers,
O'Donnell's got the Swede.
I should really tell him about Berg.
I was at his house for hanukah.
I mean, you didn't have to at all.
Especially considering what happened with my daughter.
I mean, I am fighting for everything here.
I could lose this entire organization.
This whole team.
You know what?
I got just the guy.
Two single guys at a ballgame and we're sitting in the owner's box.
I know.
How about that?
How is that lawyer?
He redid my entire divorce settlement.
You've got to use him.
Larry David, Marty Funkhouser.
Your names are not on the list.
No no no.
Didn't you recommend
Hiriam Katz to O'Donnell?
Cheryl's lawyers right now.
They're gonna finalize the papers.
I've got to get over there.
This guy doesn't have an assistant.
Don't sign anything.
I'm on my way up to your office.
Asshole.
You cost me the Dodgers.
He hit me.
What is in your nose?
It's a tampon.
Well, I got hit in the face.
You're not supposed to get the house.
He gave up my house, that idiot.?
What?
Cheryl, that's not fair.
Cheryl.
Excuse me, do you have a scissor?
I need to cut the string here.
I don't want to move, man.
I don't want to uproot again and I gotta move to a new house now.
I like this house, man.
All the bitches I had in here, man.
Fucking two bitches in your bed.
What?
Fucking two bitches in your bed.
You had sex with two women in my bedroom?
Fucking right I did.
How you gonna fuck bitches
You know what, Larry?
You done fucked that shit up. You know why? lawyer who got us kicked out of here.
You picked that fucking lawyer.
You fucking my shit up.
Okay, you know what?
We got a half hour to get out of here.
I suggest you go pack up and bring your stuff down.
Hi, Mr Larry David, we have your cookies that you ordered.
I have a vague recollection, correct me if I'm wrong,
You know what?
I got news for you.
All right, don't scream at me.
I'm not gonna be intimidated by a bunch of girl scouts.
I can tell you that.
Okay, this discussion is over.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Let it go. This is pushing buttons, and that's all right.
It's all right.
Let it go.
Sir, could you please give us a moment?
Yeah, aw.
Aw aw.
Yes, aw.
Or the right.
I'm trying to get to the chubby hubby.
Poor baby.
Sir. Excuse me.
Now I've tried to be nice.
Thank you.
Richard is dating a burlesque dancer.
All she wanted to talk about was how she dances, how the crowd
They moved the audition.
It's in 10 minutes.
Wait, she's going to commit suicide and she calls you?
A lot of people call me who are suicidal.
I don't think you'd be my suicide call.
What would bring you to the brink of suicide?
By the way, are you dating a burlesque dancer?
I didn't say anything bad.
I said she was beautiful.
You didn't swear him to secrecy.
What's the big deal?
Admit it, the only reason you're going out with her is because of her ample bosom.
That's despicable to say that to me.
Of course not. when you're going to finally look at her face?
That's really funny.
Yeah, laugh it up.
That's it?
You come for two minutes?
Quite frankly
I'm a little offended by you just focusing on a woman's breasts and nipples when maybe I'm in love with her, all right?
No, I'm not always in love.
You guys are on a fuckin' roll.
Why don't the three of us, one night this week, go see her dance?
No, let's go.
He never said we couldn't.
We can't say anything to him.
He doesn't need to know.
We sit in the back.
I say we go.
I'm gonna get going.
You got lunch?
Yeah, let's go see her.
Excuse me, I've just gotta run out for one second.
Could you just keep an eye on my computer for me?
Excuse me.
Would you mind keeping an eye on that computer?
Good, thanks.
Aha.
Ha ha.
Okay, this is the dog.
If you're gonna have a dog, you have to have a bag.
I will bring a bag.
I didn't bring a bag today.
It's a marriage.
The bag and the dog, they go together.
I just don't see why you had to yell at me.
Roscoe, come.
Don't you love this place?
Let loose. He's not here.
Have a good time. do this more often.
Come to disgusting strip clubs? inside of those motherfuckers.
She is communicating right now.
You understand?
In Hawaii they move hands and hips.
Out here it's titties.
The fuckin' titties are talking right now.
And what exactly are they saying?
Those titties are a blabbermouth, you know what I'm talking about?
He's just having fun.
How can you not tell me you were going to see Stella?
We probably should have told you.
But you didn't say we shouldn't go.
Everybody's gonna see her.
You went there like a pervert.
Hey, I didn't even see that much.
What percentage of the show did you look at her breasts?
Hi, honey.
Good to see you.
This is Larry, one of my oldest friends.
I thought you said he was old.
I didn't know Marilyn Monroe was on the base, sir.
He made out like you were a granddad, you know?
You called me old?
You're two days older than I am.
How dare you?
That's okay. By the way, I actually did see your show last night.
What do you know about burlesque?
Well, I appreciate naked women.
But let me just say this, okay?
Your breasts are magnificent.
You're not dissecting a frog
By the way, I did notice in the show that there's a small mole on the underside of your right breast that you might want to get checked out.
I have breast vision
Why don't you go to every burlesque show and just stare at all the breasts?
I could be a burlesque dermatologist.
Well well well, look who's here.
I'm the idiot who asked you to look after my computer yesterday, remember?
No, I didn't get it back.
Why am I asking you?
You were taking such a long time.
What I was about to say was why wouldn't you give it to a black person?
In fact, that day when we were in there,
I had been looking for a black person to leave my computer with.
Left it with me.
Good good.
I'm sure it's gonna turn up.
And I gave it to this guy and he never gave the computer back.
Who the fuck did you give it to?
It was a guy.
Not important.
Who the fuck did you give it to?
A black guy.
I feel fuckin' bad now.
Know what I mean?
You trusted that black motherfucker.
I don't want you thinking that shit about me, you understand?
Plenty of times, but I didn't.
I know the code to the fuckin' house and shit. 3948, right?
All you did was change it around.
All that shit I fuckin' know.
Remember that time you gave me the ATM card to get gas for the car and shit?
Come on.
It's a big L.
It's real clear, right?
Then the arry David is sloppy.
Any man can do that shit. Your mom's maiden
Who the fuck told you my mother's maiden name?
There's shit laying around the house.
I'm your neighbor Margaret.
You wouldn't move over.
It was odd.
Well, there was a little more to it than that.
I know the woman was crying.
I saw that. she could have cried a foot or two over.
I think it's very pejorative.
And speaking of those women, a couple of days ago
I think there was a little incident with one of our members and her dog.
Her dog pooped all over my lawn three times.
She doesn't clean it up.
She doesn't bring bag.
What we would love
To invite you in to start a discussion.
I don't know why I would apologize.
I didn't really do anything.
And you know what would be wonderful, Larry?
Hi. A little bit of a surprise for all of you.
What a great pleasure to meet you all.
By the way, very nice house, if you don't mind my saying.
I don't know where you were living before, but I would think this probably would be a step up.
You hit the jackpot with this place, huh?
You know what, Larry?
Thank you for admiring our home.
You're really hitting the cake here, huh?
And donuts?
You're welcome to help yourself.
I hope you guys are
My father would call this crap.
Larry, I think you might remember our friend Saundra.
Did you have anything you wanted to say to Saundra?
I'd like to say.
First off, I want to apologize if I hurt your feelings in any way as a result I want of the dog pooping.
I was just going to say th your anger is your problem and it's not my problem anymore. that Larry acknowledged your feelings and apologized.
But you know what?
I feel very good about
It's just that dogs don't really have control of when they go.
Yeah, but the owner has control of where the dog goes.
Because you really yelled at my dog.
Yeah, it's very hard to apologize to a dog because they're a stupid animal.
You know,
We're going to move on down the couch.
You did.
It's okay.
I have no problem with crying in a grocery store.
Where the Japanese food is.
The hoisin sauce
It's not like buying ice cream. we're going to concentrate on the positive part of what you had to say.
Why don't you finish what you were saying to Karen?
What a bovine she is, huh?
She's like the capo here, huh?
No. No, she's not, Larry.
Does she run the show?
Tell me the truth.
No, she doesn't.
Nobody runs the show.
Is this the inspirational speaker that we're getting?
No, that's next week.
What happened to you?
We are again going to stay in the present moment,
And I think she just got confused.
Thank you, Dale.
That darn washing machine.
I'll tell you what
I'll do for you.
If you need a machine, you're welcome to come and use my machine anytime you want.
It won't kill you.
Go ahead.
Sure. Why not?
How about the marm here, huh?
How about this marm?
That's all right, Larry.
If you touch it it's yours.
Again, thank you, Larry.
Ladies, I'm just going to walk our guest to the door.
Larry, thank you again for coming by.
Couldn't be happier.
Did you put one of these disgusting things back in here after eating it?
I might have.
I have bad manners.
There's a whole side dish here for the remnants.
I'm very happy for you.
Although if you told me that it wasn't fine,
I still would have been happy because I would have said, see? Good thing I told you to go to the doctor.
I started talking about how much pain
And I've decided
I'm going to get my breasts reduced.
I get backaches all the time.
It's really really painful.
You take an advil for that stuff.
You throw a couple of stones behind your brassiere.
Okay, boys, you obviously don't understand.
Imagine you had huge balls.
Enormous, sweaty,
You're comparing breasts with balls?
People hate balls.
Balls are reviled.
You can't even mention balls and breasts in the same breath.
Balls are disgusting they're hideous.
Everybody wants to see those.
Who wants to see balls?
Wow, I am talking to two schoolboys right now.
You don't just love me for my tits, do you?
I have to defend myself in this?
Hold it, hold it. There's many things you can say about this guy.
How could you even suggest that I would think that?
Look, you hurt the man.
You hurt the man.
Look at him.
It's insulting.
I'm there for you, regardless of what you have to do, because I love you.
Thank you, sweetie.
I'm just going to the loo, okay? for Christ's sake.
You did this.
You're responsible for this.
You looked at her mole with a goddamn telescope like Galileo jerking off from 40' away.
I had breast vision,
I told you.
Because of you I'm going to lose this beautiful woman with that figure, with those boobs.
What am I supposed to do now? to the D, yes.
What's closer to the D, the minus or the plus?
I don't give a shit, quite frankly.
This is not algebra.
This is my life.
Yeah, what gives her the right? half of it taken off.
Reduce them by half.
There shouldn't be a motherfucker cutting titties down.
You don't fuckin' wanna reduce your titties by half and expect a motherfucker to be happy with that shit.
Why do you keep asking me that?
I know what the fuck you're saying.
I explain it to you and you don't fucking get it.
I get it.
You want to give me a test on it?
You like fucking full titties or half titties?
You got two half titties, right?
We could talk till we're blue in the face.
I don't mean that as a racial thing either.
Would I ever turn fucking blue?
You say that to white people too.
You can't turn blue?
Never seen a black blush in my fuckin' life.
Blacks don't fuckin' blush.
Me and you couldn't take that bitch.
I bet she heard about it from a friend in there.
Gotta find out what the fuck the story is.
I'm going to find out right now.
Shit.
You know, wound up over there.
Take care of yourself.
Because the thing about it is that
I just don't see anybody taking you down.
Ahh.
Can you tell me how it happened?
No. I fell.
Yeah, I fell.
I trip all the time.
But, you know,
I deserved it actually.
You need money?
I gave you $40 yesterday. all this fuckin' time and shit.
Can't you see I'm in pain here?
But I'm fuckin' hungry right now.
Fruit chews? You know how bad those are for your teeth?
You want to spend the winter in the dentist's office?
You know I got you.
Give me a few dollars.
All right.
You know, I didn't even ask him to move in.
He just moved in, doesn't pay any rent and he eats all my food.
He knows all about me.
He knows my mother's maiden name.
I've got to get this guy out of my house. that you'd like to tell me about this accident?
This is completely in confidence.
Good.
What's happening?
Stella is going through with the breast reduction on Friday.
I'm going to throw myself and those breasts a farewell party like they've never seen in their lives.
Because I'm going to go to the Biltmore downtown.
I'm going to have all their favorite frozen margaritas and put flowers there.
It's like the last time you're going to see them,
I told you to give it to the guy when he comes back in, and what?
You're not the guy.
All right, I made a mistake.
I think all computers look alike.
Well, it looks like you could take care of yourself, honestly.
It's me, Bob, from the restaurant,
I had to take off.
I know you asked me to watch the computer, but nobody else looked trustworthy.
I'd track you down.
And now we can find the rightful owner.
Nobody else looked trustworthy.
And I thought you took it.
Hi, sir. We're responding to a domestic battery call.
I don't live here.
The owner of the house, he just left.
See, the owner, he just walked out.
He'll be right back.
Apparently you've been living here with Mr David and he's been trying to get rid of you.
It's all in the doctor's statement.
No no no no no.
Look, we can just talk to Mr David.
A computer. I don't live here.
You're making a mistake.
Wait for the guy to come back.
Hey, Richie boy.
How's it going?
Having fun?
See? That was nice. Right? club champions.
I really do.
I really think we have a great chance this year.
No, I've just gotta get back.
I told Ilene I'd be back
What about Funkhouser?
Will you call him?
I'll call him.
He'll be there tomorrow.
I don't know what the hell he's doing.
He's just gonna come out here on Saturday and play great?
Jeez. Is there anything more pathetic than a cowering, emasculated Jew who ha to run home to his wife?
Imagine how he'd be if he was married to Susie.
He'd have pee stains on his pants constantly.
He has no balls.
Let's do it. That's all I've ever heard is how great it is.
Fantastic.
Okay, let's go.
Mmm, I've never had chicken like this.
Look at these posters, huh? not like the Jews.
Jews ever walked in here.
What these people should do is send their chicken over to Israel.
They'd take down all those settlements in the morning.
Believe me.
You know what?
This would be a fantastic place for Jews who are cheating on their spouses
Because no Jews ever come here.
No one you know is ever gonna see you here.
Looks like they're planning the next intifada at this table, but look at this woman.
Could be the next Mrs David. she's gonna get over
She almost took my head off, but
I don't like those teachers.
I don't. Turn the boys
I tried to back up with mirrors only.
Hey, Funkhouser's in there too.
He's got a little surprise for you.
We were just talking about the golf tournament.
Thank you for allowing him to play in it.
How did he hit your car?
Not enough space.
I'm just gonna take a look at it.
All right, what the hell is this?
I went through a bit of a midlife crisis and I rededicated my life to judaism. and I didn't realize it.
I went to rabbi Stein. Do you know her?
I go there every night.
We talk.
She's invigorating me.
Is that why you haven't been practicing?
We're depending on you.
I hope you've got your swing.
When are you gonna come back to earth, huh?
I'm living under a mitzvah.
What the hell is she doing here?
Why shouldn't she be here?
What do you mean?
It's a dinner party for adults.
You know what? I have a challah in the car that I'll bring in.
I need you to keep me away from no matter what.
That's enough.
They're opening up a second location right next door to Goldblatt's deli.
How in the world, can they dare open up a palestinian chicken restaurant next to the sacred land of that deli?
Hey, this is America.
They can do whatever they want.
I mean, they can legally do it, true.
But should they?
It's insensitive.
Why can't they open it a few blocks uptown?
They should move it a mile away.
I hear the chicken's really good, by the way.
I tell you what I heard.
There's gonna be a rally next week at this new location they're trying to open.
We should all show up at the rally and try to stop them from opening it.
Jeff and I are in.
We're in on the rally.
I'm gonna make placards and everything.
I'll love to join you, but I'm already committed to the rally on the other side of
Goldblatt's at the German place.
Not at all. Not at all.
Hey, I got a good joke.
This is right up your alley, okay, Funkman?
A woman goes to a gynecologist.
He says, get up on the table, put your feet in the stirrups and spread your legs wide.
He goes, my God, Mrs
What's the big deal?
It's just a little joke.
Excuse me.
What's the matter with you?
Telling a joke like that in front of her.
What are you bringing your daughter to an adult dinner party for?
She's an adult.
She can come to an adult dinner party.
She's an adult? If she's an adult, why can't she hear a dirty joke?
She's an adult when she turns 13 or learns to make her first latkes.
You told me specifically not to let you have any dessert.
I appreciate it, Larry, but I changed my mind.
Ah. Yes yes yes,
I'm changing it, and now I'm saying thank you for helping me.
That's why you say no matter what.  This is the what.
She said, no matter what, okay?
Give me the cake, Larry.
What are you doing? estimate on the car. forget the insurance.
I'll just write you a check.
I'll take care of it.
Well, I think that's one way to do it, but let me propose an alternative here.
Indulge me for a second.
Last night at that dinner party,
You tell people how you're with the potatoes, for example. You know?
I couldn't say that. You're the only one who can come out with it, you know?
And then Jeff and Susie with the kid.
What was the kid doing there, right?
Why do you bring your daughter to an adult dinner party?
Exactly. You say what everybody's thinking.
You just come out with it.
It's impressive, you know?
She'll kill me.
Are you kidding?
We'll get into a fight, it'll last for months.
Susie's twin sister.
You could say it to her, you know?
You know? You just put it out there, 'cause that's what you do.
And I'll tell you what.
You do that for me, you see this estimate?
Gone. I will tear it up. a load off my shoulders,
Honey, can you get the rest of the bags?
I noticed you were all alone at the party.
A date is an experience you have with another person saying that, don't you?
It's cute, right? why aren't you laughing out loud?
Why say it?
That's what that is.
You're verbal texting.
Excuse me, is this your little idea?
Did my pissant husband tell you to do this? my kitchen, telling me how I'm supposed to respond to your jokes?
Did you tell him to come over to me and tell me how I should
Did I tell Larry that?
Of course I wouldn't tell Larry that.
I express myself?
He said he'd forget about the money for the car, which is $573, if I tell her to stop
I know. By the way,
I was this close
I cannot believe we talked him into coming here.
Shalom. You know,
I thought all last night, if rabin can break bread with Arafat,
I can have chicken at
Okay, that's just not gonna work.
I can't go in wearing this yarmulke?
What is this, the raid on Entebbe? don't you reach for that.
Don't you ever touch that.
Give it to me.
Don't ever grab my yarmulke, ever.
How dare you?
A big Jew. Big.
A big Jew and you still told him to take off his Jew cap.
My name is Shara.
Mmm.
It'll pale in comparison.
How can you even have meals after this? just walked in.
He's cheating on Juliet?
All right, listen.
Juliet is great friends with Susie.
If he's cheating on Juliet,
I can't be here to see it.
It's great to see you.
And let me just say
Because you know what?
You know, we always liked each other and now we like each other a little more.
Well, there's always been a lot of tension there, but let's just say this was the straw that broke the camel's back.
He doesn't like the way
It's a wonderful thing to say.
I think it's cool, it's funny.
I think if you didn't want to sleep with her, you wouldn't be
Well, that goes without saying, but look, if Ron finds out, this could be very awkward.
We won't be able to play on the same team and then we won't win the tournament.
If anyone quits, we're disqualified.
In other words, no matter what?
By the way, your lunch is on me. me the only reason that they're having this affair  Thing. I drove her to it.
Well, I'm sure there was other things that drove her to it too.
No, I was the straw that broke the camel's back.
I've gotta be careful with this
If Ron finds out about Eddie and Ilene,
Hey, nice pillow.
I look like I've got a kitty and we're making evil plans.
Here, just put it on your lap.
I want to talk to you about.
I think I know what it is.
That's not why
I got up and left.
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
She smacks her lips together and does this little ahh thing.
Look, I'm flattered, kid, that you would consider me for such a delicate assignment, but I have
I'm out of that business.
He can't stand up to her.
He's scared of her.
You're the only one who can do it.
As tempting as it is, kid,
Boy, you really are your mother's daughter, aren't you?
Yeah, now get the fuck out of my driveway, you bald prick.
Fuck me, you fucking Jew.
You zionist pig.
You occupying fuck.
I'm going to fuck the Jew out of you.
You want to fuck me like Israel fucked my country?
Yeah, take it, Jew.
Take it, Jew.
Oh.
Fuck me, you Jew bastard.
Fuck me like
Israel fucks my people.
Show me the promised land, huh?
Keep my father out of it, will you? we seek him there, those frenchies seek him everywhere, is he in heaven, is he in hell?
That damned elusive pimpernel.
Funkman.
Look who's here.
Well well.
Martin, Shara.
Shara, Martin.
All right then.
Shall we?
Good night.
Yeah, small price to pay for the best sex
I've ever had anywhere.
This woman is amazing.
When did you have your orgasm?
When she said she'd fuck the Jew out of you?
The penis doesn't care about race, creed and color.
The penis wants to get to his homeland.
It wants to go home.
I came over here for another reason.
Rabbi Stein said that I can't play in the golf tournament Saturday because I have to honor the sabbath.
You're koufaxing us?
The tournament won't let us get anybody else, and if you don't play, we all drop out.
It's over for us.
I'm following her lead.
She told me what I have to do.
I'd love you to.
She's in the valley off of Brookhurst.
And if she gives the okay, would you play?
I'll be there.
Our friendship is about that much now.
I'll tell you what. If you you don't play in that golf tournament,
You're not even a man anymore.
Mommy rabbi says don't play, little boy.
Yarmulke on the floor. Oh.
Fantastic.
Well, keep that away from me no matter what.
How did you get the rabbi to let me play?
You made a trade with the rabbi?
Hey, I just found out the klein team blew up.
We're four strokes ahead after this hole.
All we have to do is finish on 18 and we win.
We're gonna win a tournament.
Ahh.
You know what?
Fuck you, don't come home tonight.
He didn't say it. It was me.
What? Ilene, are you serious?
This is fucking ridiculous.
This is how you treat a friend?
Are you fucking kidding me?
You know what? Fuck this whole thing.
Where you going?
Can you move forward, please?
Larry. Come.
Join us over here.
Come with us.
You're a Jew.
No, Larry.
Come to this side and I'm yours.
Larry, I'm yours whenever you want. the three of us.
All right, that's enough.
Just get the fuck over here.
Hello?
No, I can't find it.
Yeah, you know, my assistant's not here. where it is.
Thank you.
Where's Antoinette?
Doesn't she remind you of these things?
He's kind of, you know, lingering. that his daughter's job was in jeopardy, based on hanging on, he'd die.
Maybe if she just said, dad,
I've got to get back to work.
Hey, I'm Dino from Big Dog productions.
I'm moving in next door.
You've heard of the shark show, right, Great White Wonderland?
Do you mind if I take a cabinet?
You never give up a cabinet.
Never give up a cabinet.
Okay, thank you very much.
But you're shitting where you eat.
We love this restaurant.
You're never gonna be able to come back here.
Inevitably I will break up with her.
All right.
Ah, she texted me.
She texted you, how adorable.
See, I hate that. about the smiley faces.
I can't stand it.
I think it'd be best if we'd bow out of Saturday night.
Saturday night?
Sure.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
That was gorgeous.
By the way, things many times are not great with Susie and I.
It was very sweet.
Be careful about the smiley faces.
Do you see anything on my forehead?
Is there a little mark there?
Why can't you kiss and talk?
I just saw this hilarious YouTube video.
This woman, she gets robbed, right? that's not the funny part.
The funny thing is my mom's the one who sent it to me.
Cause I heard you guys talking.
You can talk and make out.
Well, not if it's good.
Okay, now you've heard of it. Tsk.
Have fun talking.
Ha ha.
Maybe this is a good break in the action.
But that was fun.
Just I can pay you back when
I see you at the restaurant. and go to the farmer's market and
Bye.
Why's that?
Look at this.
What'd you do?
You stuffed me into one cabinet.
Looks like it all fit in there.
I gave you a cabinet.
You took two?
That's not fair.
Well, right now I have two people, yeah, but I told you I'm doing the shark show.
They're gonna be back.
When they're done shooting the sharks, they will come back.
You want to be fair about this thing?
I'll take this cabinet, you take that cabinet and we'll split this one.
No.
This stays exactly the way it is.
Okay?
Peace, brother.
Peace.
Hi, how are you doing?
I think, yeah.
They don't tell you anything.
What kind of mood are they in when
Do they kind of huddle together and whisper?
No.
Do they seem morose?
Lugubrious?
No, they take tests
I don't know if I pass or fail.
Hmm.
Hey, thanks for calling.
And I had to give up a cabinet.
Larry, no.
You never give up a cabinet.
Never ever give up a cabinet.
This is why you need to be here.
Can't you come in for a day?
You know, straighten up a little bit.
Maybe you can get one back.
I'm 15 minutes late already.
See, this is why I need you to come in.
I'll be there tomorrow.
No, I was at the dermatologist.
And he kept me waiting for 45 minutes.
Are you lying to me?
They went no, I wasn't there.
Cause he's a cool guy and now he's turning into one of those guys in Beverly Hills.
You know, they keep you waiting there in the room there with 1300 other people.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Wow, you never told me about Heidi.
Anyway, I didn't want to interrupt.
I just wanted to say hi and tell you to have a nice lunch.
Bye.
You work 20 seconds from here.
I say that I will eat here again.
Still, it's a question of character.
This is what a desk should look like.
Yeah, how did it get that way, by the way?
You know, it just builds up.
You came in for one day, tomorrow you'll go back to the hospital.
And I am gonna get that cabinet back for us.
Okay, I'm gonna just unpack that stuff. and say how excited we are for dinner.
You know I'm taking out the hostess from the restaurant?
But, wait, I am dying to know why in the hell aren't Jeff and Susie coming?
I don't know.
He didn't tell me.
It doesn't matter and you haven't said a word.
It's true, you do know nothing.
There's nothing to know.
Larry David's office.
Okay, yeah, I'll be there.
My dad just died. he said was where's Antoinette?
Guess where I was.
Huh.
That is what we call in my business a benign keratosis.
You'll be fine.
I was sick from this, honest to God.
I'm glad you came in.
All you have to do is cover this with a little 100 sunblock and you'll be fine.
Antoinette's father Jim.
Ah, well.
You know that he and I used to play in a band together for a while. and asked me to play at his funeral.
I'm playing
Danny Boy on the flute.
Richard Lewis, he's a friend of yours, is he not?
He recently canceled an appointment with me at the last minute and hasn't rescheduled yet.
Have you any idea why such a thing would take place?
Nope.
And several people who he has referred to me have canceled at the last minute and have not rescheduled.
Well, it's a mystery to me.
I wouldn't worry about it.
He's a little nutty.
Listen, as long as you're here, it's been about two years since you've been here.
It's important I take a look at you.
It will be the briefest look at your penis, believe me.
It's routine and it is strictly necessary, all right?
Ye, I am putting it away.
Right here.
I have no space in here, so where do you suggest I put it?
This space has to remain clean.
There can be no bullshit on this counter, do you understand?
By the way, you're the one who took my stuff out of these two cabinets and put it into this one.
You're telling me it's unfair the amount of cabinet space
There are two things about Dog that everybody knows, okay?
I am clean and I am fair.
These cabinets
For Big Dog only.
For Big Dog only.
Big shit.
Look, Big Dog does not give up cabinets.
This food is staying here because
I have no place to put it.
This isn't even food.
What the fuck is this?
You got pudding in here, okay?
You got fucking pudding. Gimme a break.
Chocolate pretzels?
Get the hell out of here.
What do you got in here?
This weighs almost five lbs. You eat this?
You put this in your body?
Yeah, it's good bread.
It has no yeast in it.
By the way, I saw the show?
It stinks.
The sharks are swimming around.
And you know what?
I'm not calling you Dog anymore.
The Dog days are over.
From now on, you're Dino.
You said fuck you, Dog to me?
Take your fucking rabbit food stick it up your fucking ass.
Huh.
That's all you have to say when
I tell you my father died?
What should I have said?
Sad news?
I don't think so.
I forgot to put sunblock on.
I'm just gonna return it.
I don't need it.
I return.
The 60 bucks that you lent me?
No, of course not.
Although, I mean, now that you mention it.
I did give you $60.
I guess it's kind of, what?
In your wallet now.
This is ridiculous.
I can't believe you would actually need to get $60 back from me.
I don't think you would have.
Okay, you know what, Larry?
I've really tried, but the truth is
Did you get the whole head?
Yes, I did.
Excuse me.
I believe they refer to that as a smiley face.
They're frequently used by idiots at the end of emails and text messages,
You're probably right about that.
Not much I can do about it.
I have a hat in my car.
It's a Dodger hat.
Yeah, I hate the Dodgers.
That's okay.
Mom, it's Larry.
I believe that's called a smiley face. drew it with sunblock and then
I fell asleep in the sun.
She owed me $60 and wouldn't pay me,
They loved each other very much.
It's very hard on her.
And she was not at her father's bedside when he passed away.
You know, the bedside's a little overrated, frankly.
Not that much goes on there.
You think they're gonna say
They're not saying Rosebud, whatever that is.
Obviously she's grieving deeply for her father.
Grieving process might take for her?
It's going to take probably several weeks for my daughter to get back to work.
Mmmm, I don't know,
Maybe I could fill in for her.
Wow, this is a very exciting and interesting idea.
Don't wear that hat.
I was fresh out of business school, clutching my little CPA degree in my hot hand.
He saw a little piece of music sticking out of the corner of my briefcase.
And he said, you play?
He hired me that day right on the spot.
He thought I had a lot of
How's that rash?
More than you do apparently.
You canceled our appointment last week.
I canceled my appointment because you made Larry David wait 45 minutes before you saw him.
No way I'm waiting 45 minutes for
Wait wait wait.
I beg your pardon.
I made Larry David wait 45 minutes for an appointment?
I never let any of my patients wait 45 minutes.
That is a boldfaced lie.
I'm saying he lied.
What an asshole he is.
What an asshole he is.
I still have the rash.
That jerk.
Pull over, Mr David, please.
I'd like to speak with you.
Thank you.
What this I hear?
I made you wait 3 and 4s of an hour?
What the hell's that sunburn on your head?
You have slandered me, my friend. this lunch with Richard Lewis and I've been late a few times with him and I need an excuse
Body survey?
If you don't sneak a peek
Where the hell's the procession?
I'm supposed to play Danny Boy on my flute at the graveside.
Where the hell's the cemetery?
Do you know where it is?
I don't know.
Where did they go?
Rivkin is.
I don't know what to tell you.
I hear he keeps his patients waiting all the time.
Yeah well, I'm canceling my appointment.
Excuse me, Larry.
Here's your tea.
By the way, I gotta tell you, you're doing a fantastic job.
I like this new system you installed here.
You put my change in here.
I mean, come on.
And I am going to get that cabinet back.
Mr Greene.
She's amazing. I'd love to fire
Antoinette and hire her permanently.
I can't do that.
Nobody could pull that off.
I'll just put these on his desk.
How are you doing?
You holding up okay? at times it's very difficult because I do miss him very very much.
Hey, Dog.
That's my kitchen too.
I've got a cabinet in there.
Hey, Larry.
How are you, man?
Hey, what's up, man?
Pfft, you know what, Stu?
The thing is things aren't great right now between me and Heidi.
You're actually gonna use the same bullshit excuse that Jeff did?
That Jeff's having an affair.
What, is she insane?
Why would she do that? to your office your voice went up. cocksucking fucking fatso.
Antoinette's mother.
You're fucking Antoinette's mother?
Yes, I know, but I shat where I ate.
And now I shall eat where I shat.
My relationship with you is over, but my relationship with this restaurant lives on.
Is everything okay with your meal?
Look at this.
Takes up two spaces, parks over the line.
Everybody's gotta move down now because of him.
It's a big opportunity for Sammi.
Not everybody gets into the
You've never seen her.
I'm not criticizing.
I don't think she wants to do it.
You're an asshole. You know what the best thing about going to New York is?
I'm not gonna see your face for three months.
Why did you have to take up two parking spaces?
You made me take two parking spaces, okay?
Yes, I can understand that you're upset.
Hey, Vance, Vance, thanks for coming.
Hey, Vance.
What's with you?
What, have you got laryngitis?
Vow of silence.
Spiritual advisor?
Is that what you just said?
And he told you to do this?
For what purpose?
You know, I've tried to get
Susie to take a vow of silence.
That's never gonna happen.
I have too many important things to say.
See, that's funny.
Meanwhile, he's trying to communicate it.
It's okay to mouth.
You're still communicating, but in a much less effective way.
All right,
I can't understand you.
Yeah, you two go, go eat.
Go stuff your face, both of you.
He's an asshole.
Tessler is coming tonight.
I'm pretty sure.
I just wanted to give you a heads up on that.
Positive. She'll be picking up a plate any second.
Hi, first of all.
Congratulations on a great attempt at a chat and cut.
Really good. 99 times out of 100, that's gonna work.
Unfortunately,
I happen to be what you're talking about.
This poor, innocent fellow to sneak into the line.
Do you know her at all?
I mean, to be fair, we met like
He's been manipulated.
You manipulated him, that's what it is.
You want me to get back in line?
Would that make you feel better?
You are unbelievable, you know that?
Yeah, because, you know what?
I'm not even gonna say anything this time.
I respect your skills, really.
Seriously, how much would it take for you to see, Eat Pray Love?
It's not that bad of a movie. We saw it.
To actually go to the theater and sit in the theater?
In veterinary school, do you tend to focus more on the dog, let's say,
No you focus and you say you love that roach,
I'm gonna do what I can to give it every chance it has.
I mean, that's all I can do.
When do you get the reports on Oscar, by the way?
I meant to ask you that.
I'm crossing my fingers for you.
I appreciate that.
Thank you, my friend.
You see a rat in the house, you don't want to kill it?
Yes, if I see a rat in the house, I want to kill it.
What if you injured it?
Would you then bring it into his office for him to save it?
You see what I'm getting at?
Mmm, no.
He saves pets.
Pigs, things of that nature?
Every now and then a pig, once a horse, but it's pretty rare.
I don't know why they don't have specialties.
I'm a donkey vet.
I'm a rabbit vet.
I'm a turtle vet.
You know what I mean?
The way you're saying it, it's almost like there should be a doctor who handles just feathers.
Yes. How does a vet do?
What do they make, a guy like that?
A vet, do they make as much as a doctor?
Okay, when is the last time you jacked off?
Mmm. This morning.
Listen, I'm glad
I ran into you.
Do you know anything about Keegan's club?
It's like a field day,
Spend the whole day with kids physical problems, mental problems, learning problems.
It's kind of like a workshop.
It's comical, but it's all with the love, you know?
Where you going?
Keegan's club.
I'll send you the literature.
Maybe next year or the next time we have an event,
We'll miss you this year, but next year we won't.
Hey, Richie,
I'm on my way to the vet's.
I'm gonna meet Jeff for lunch.
You should just let him take care of it.
What are you,
Dr. Dolittle?
Anyway, do you want to go to lunch with us?
No, I can't.
I'm going to the doctor's.
Well, then what about Friday?
We'll have lunch on Friday.
I'll meet you at that place on Wilshire and 24th.
All right, see you.
Waiting for the word from the doctor.
I don't know.
I'll eat anything.
There's a great Mexican place right down the road.
I'm reading all this mercury stuff.
I'm scared to get Sushi.
I don't like to have hot food for lunch.
What about a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
I don't want bread.
I don't want to have bread.
Peanut butter and jelly just on a plate with a fork?
Let's go to Gjelina.
The tests came back positive for leptospirosis.
I was just telling Susie we're gonna have to put Oscar down.
We will make him and you as comfortable as possible. who would confide in you if she was upset?
We're still talking about my wife right now?
Like a married relationship?
Yeah. You discuss things like that?
She doesn't care about you.
You're not the center of the universe.
Right now Oscar is.
He's gonna die any minute now, okay?
You know what I mean? curious, that's all.
I encourage it.
Can you go get it, Jeff? Okay?
You're not going to lunch.
You're going to Pinkberry and you're coming back.
But neither of us have eaten since breakfast.
I don't really give a shit about you.
I care about
Oscar right now, okay?
He's in pain.
He needs his last meal.
Don't drive a red Volvo.
Ah. Wow.
Excuse me, are you happy with that park?
No, you're a foot over the line.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, I suppose that's an idea,
Just say, you know what?
I'll do better next time. what you think of my parking job, okay, pal?
It's not an open field.
It's not a farm, okay?
It's not that hard.
Look, just pull in between the lines.
Why don't you stay between the lines of your own goddamn business, huh?
Why don't you stay confined within the lines of not being an asshole?
Cause you're way over that line.
I'm sure you will too, at everyone else's expense.
Yo. What are you doing?
Nothing.
Talking to my friend.
I know what he's doing.
He's about to do a chat and cut.
No no no. No, I know
Yeah, 'cause you were chatting with your friend
Please please, don't insult me, okay?
I invented the chat and cut.
This is amateur hour.
All right.
Okay. I'm going.
They had to postpone it.
Bedbug infestation on the nap mats.
It's beautiful. A beautiful thing.
Yeah. The good news is you're gonna be around for it though.
Hopefully within the month, probably more likely six to eight weeks. Yeah.
Jesus, I can't believe it.
I'm going back to New York. what did you say it was?
Six weeks on our end, approximately.
With anybody.
I'm the world's fastest prep as a director. You know that.
I wanna do it. I don't even wanna do it for them.
I'm starving too.
Why do we listen to her?
I've got low blood sugar.
One bite but make it small.
Small small small. give it here for a second.
Let me have a taste.
Ah. It's good.
Your taste was about twice as big as mine.
No, it was about as twice as big as mine.
I can't even see what you're eating.
Look at that. Look at the size of those bites you took.
Are you serious?
Come on, that's not fair.
One more. Last one, okay?
We'll have one more.
One each more, okay?
Thank you.
All right. Okay. All right, you want to be a dick, be a dick.
Be a fucking dick. Okay? hell you're trying to say.
Will you just talk, please?
Pinkberry.
See you, Vance.
Get that off.
They're never closed.
They're open till, like, midnight.
You know,
Koreans own Pinkberry.
Pinkberry as a last meal. you know, when they're about to be electrocuted.
The Pinkberry'll melt.
It'll never get there in time.
I'll bet you there's a couple of decent ones near a prison.
No, it's gross.
It's full of my snot.
Put the tissue in my hand.
You know what?
You've gone through enough today you don't need to be looking at garbage.
Hey, Lewis, where the hell are you?
I'm sitting here like an idiot for 20 minutes.
I thought we were supposed to have lunch.
Give me a call. by the whole neighborhood.
I waited half an hour.
You didn't confirm.
There's no way I'm gonna go there.
I didn't confirm?
The plan is the confirmation. have to make another plan.
The plan is a plan.
A confirmation is a guarantee
Well, I'll need a confirmation.
You're not getting a confirmation.
You've got the plan. You've got the confirmation.
You've got a subcommittee.
But you'll really be in deep shit if you don't.
Do you believe this crap?
Look at this.
I've gotta get out.
A Shiva call for a dog?
Have you ever heard of anything like that?
I only met him once and he nipped at me.
I shouldn't even be here.
I didn't even like the dog.
Hi. Hi. This is my friend Richard.
What the fuck is that?
He's taken a vow of silence,
And I can't help feeling,
Vance, that I failed him.
And you're a spiritual person.
You understand this.
He loved Pinkberry and Larry and Jeff went to get it and it was closed.
And I feel such a sense of guilt.
Mmm. loved him, didn't they, Jeff?
There's a hose?
I don't have a hose.
Pizza. Who has pizza
What do you mean you went on a helicopter ride?
Why would you tell us now about your helicopter ride?
What you need is
Oscar's bowl on display.
You what?
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tell on me?
You're going to tattle, is that it?
There's a lot of bad karma attached to tattling.
Are you aware of that?
Yeah? No, I don't want to leave him out of it, because nobody likes a tattletale.
You won't say anything?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
There he is.
You keep saying goodbye. and then the trip got delayed again.
I'm not surprised.
I ran into Vance and he told me.
Boy, for a guy that can't talk, he has a pretty big mouth, doesn't he?
Yeah, well, he just mentioned you were still here. please do the event, 'cause it just got moved up to Friday.
I wish I could.
I wish I could,
I'm actually going back tomorrow.
A lot of it depends on Jerry's schedule, which is crazy.
Like I told you earlier, this to anybody.
You know what?
Your business is your business.
I was originally gonna spend this next couple of months in New York doing but then I got Pandemonium.  We're shooting it right across the street. if you need a place in New York, it's on 66th and Broadway.
Beautiful place.
Why don't I just let you have the place?
He offered it to me.
I had to say no.
Well, he would just wanna give me his apartment?
It's sitting empty. He's gonna be in Malta for the next six months.
But why would he offer it to me?
I don't feel right about that.
You need a place to stay, Larry, and you are going to New York, aren't you?
No no. If I drive by your house,
I'm not gonna see you out there.
Three months, right?
Okay, I'll tell him three months minimum.
He's gonna be happy to help you out.
Good to see you, Larry.
No, the food here is incredible.
Hey, Vance, what did you think of dinner? the last time we see him.
Three months, we're gonna be in New York.
Hey, what are you doing?
Wait there. I'll join you.
You're not gonna believe what's happened.
Great great great, I'll see you in a couple of minutes.
Okay, you gonna come with us?
All right.
Can't call him.
We can't call him.
I understood that.
He said bye.
The red Volvo?
Again.
Jesus.
What an asshole.
I don't know. I was thinking Pinkberry.
You wanna go to Pinkberry?
You know what?
I got your little note.
Vance? Talking?
Hey, Susie, guess what?
Larry ate Oscar's Pinkberry.
And Jeff was driving.
Mmm.
I'm here.
Excuse me.
Welcome aboard.
Pinkberry?
No, thank you.
Are you really pushing my drink back?
That's a penalty.
Passage or penalty?
Look at this.
Look at the size of these laces.
Okay.
I could do better than this.
I'll pick it up.
Excuse me.
Do you mind my asking where you're going?
I was going to go to the bathroom.
This bathroom is for coach passengers only.
Really?
Well, I understand and I empathize with you
Just 'cause I'm sitting up there you're making a generalization about me.
But I'm not like
I just want to pee
Miss.
Miss.
Yes sir, can I help you?
No, I don't want water.
I said scotch with two ice cubes.
No water.
For Christ's sake, I'll get it myself.
Where's the drink cart?
You get out of my face.
Just get the fucking drink.
That is it.
I'm going to speak to the captain.
No, I am going to speak to the captain.
Don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.
I'll go back to my seat.
Thank you. Sir, that man was abusive and he was drunk.
Good job.
Trying to help.
Huh.
You are.
You're a hero.
That too, I suppose.
Larry.
Larry. with these shoelaces now?
I mean, I'm tripping over these laces five times a day.
But you got a girl out of it.
She thinks I'm a hero.
Only you and I know you weren't an intentional hero.
You don't think there's any way in the world
Impossible. Ricky Gervais is sitting in the booth behind you.
Can I turn around
You know they replaced all the lighting here. going until you've turned around.
I've been hoping to sign him.
Would you like me to get a bottle of wine for Mr Gervais?
See, you've got to be careful with these waiters.
They come over to your table, they eavesdrop.
I think that's why they're always pouring the water.
I think that's one of the perks of the job is picking up the tidbits.
It's a tidbit festival.
Enjoy.
A $300 bottle of wine?
Are you serious?
Look.
He looks very happy.
I agree with you.
But listen, man, I am starving.
My blood sugar is just going down to my feet.
I feel, like, faint.
What is he doing? He's just sitting there schmoozing with them?
Yeah, it's like he found a new best friend.
You know what?
How about if I just go get it?
All right.
Thank you.
I brought it here.
You understand I'm the waiter?
This man is a hero.
He just revolutionized the way restaurants work, my friend.
No one's gonna go hungry again.
I just can't believe, quite honestly, that I haven't heard about what happened on the plane, Larry.
I mean, do you remember
Sully Sullenberger?
When he landed that plane in New York City right there in the water, that was inspiring to people.
That's interesting.
I never made the Sully connection before.
I wonder what Sully would have done if he was in my shoes?
Not that I'm comparing myself to Sully.
People should know that you did this.
This is a whole other side of you that people don't know about.
You know about it.
That's enough for me.
It's funny, you know?
I've never really been tested like that before.
Once I went to the seventh game of a world series and came home on the subway and it was very crowded and hot and disgusting.
But I maintained my composure.
I thought that was a good sign.
Thank God you were on the plane.
That's all I have to say.
Keep the change.
No wine?
Everybody brings wine.
I bring bread.
Oh. than on the plane, I guarantee.
What is that, Lar?
Enjoy.
This is what you bring?
Yeah, but this doesn't go with my menu.
You don't know what I'm serving.
Don't impose your desires on my whole cuisine.
Star power.
The funniest show in the history of television.
I wouldn't call it the funniest show in the history of television.
I would, Lar.
This show was hilarious.
No doubt about it, funny show.
But the history of television?
Seinfeld, lovely show.
Well, thank you. It was good.
There was good.
What, do you mean it's odd because you've never heard of it?
I'm sure there's loads of things that go on that you've never heard of that aren't odd.
What's this deal?
You got a scarf?
It's not like tv.
It looks slightly affected.
Yeah, I was worried about that.
It's one man's fear of the outbreak of World War I.
And he's worried about what will happen to Britain.
I'll get you a couple of tickets.
You know what?
I'd love to.
Donna is working tomorrow night.
She can't come.
But you could still come though.
Tickets will be at the box office.
You know, it was like a $300 bottle of wine.
Was it?
I didn't look at the price.
Who? Who?
I would think I'd better look at the price.
I don't want to take advantage.
No, I'd never say it.
This very generous person bought me a bottle of wine,
I don't think I'll take advantage of him.
It doesn't matter.
It's a gift, that's how I look at it. dinner is served.
There's place cards on the table.
Find your name.
All right, everyone.
Bon appétit.
Thank you.
To our first dinner party.
First of many.
I am. I am the husband of the brit.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
You know, totally ridiculous.
That's true.
You know, when I first saw you
I guessed you for a spaniard.
Yeah.
I'm not a fan of the Spanish.
Why is that?
By spaniards?
Yeah.
I don't know where they were from.
What is that? It's not my bread.
Larry brought it.
Yes. You know what?
You don't know anything about bread.
I know that you're meant to be able to eat it at least.
Right. It's supposed to be toasted, okay?
You know what?
Talk to your friends and neighbors down at that end of the table.
Annoying everybody.
What the hell?
Why would you ask me that?
Okay, fine.
It's all right.
You know, it's fine.
It's okay.
How often do you have sex?
What we did is we made another one further down
Yeah, it was amazing.
You know what?
This is not fair what's going on here.
You fixed this whole thing, okay?
You got Ricky Gervais, you got
Ally, you got your Broadway stars.
What are you, in third grade?
Excuse me, Susie.
It's very expensive.
That's okay.
I'm good for it.
That's exactly how Larry fell into the guy on the plane.
Larry, is that true?
You know what, Larry? I think you're taking the wrong tactic with these women.
I really do. I think you have to present who you really are.
A phony, a fraud, a prevaricator.
And she either accepts you or not.
I took her home at the end of the night.
She's lost all respect for me.
Honestly, this whole thing never would have happened if you didn't separate the couples.
We became a couple because we didn't want to be separated.
My dinner party, you play by my rules.
You know what? Don't invite me anymore.
How about that?
I don't have any choice.
You're like an appendage to us.
Hey, Larry David.
Ricky Gervais left a ticket for me.
Here you go.
It's $200.
They're charging me $200 for the ticket.
I thought he was giving it to me for free.
That's my ticket.
I had the aisle ticket.
Larry, we had three seats, they were the house seats and any one of us could sit in any of these seats.
No, you weren't there when I got the envelopes.
I took them out and put them together.
Hey, don't fuck things up for me.
Sit down.
God damn it.
Sit next to your husband.
I don't want to sit next to my husband.
I'm with him all the time.
He's your best friend, you sit next to him.
Last night it was okay to sit next to him.
That was fine, right?
You separate the couples but you sit next to your husband.
I'm a little confused.
Okay? And tonight it's like
Mr Simmington.
Yes? Yes?
Of course I've heard.
It's in the morning paper.
It's not every day that Archduke Franz Ferdinand is struck down by an assassin's bullet.
I'm scrunched in here.
I want that seat.
You're a girl?
You're a witch.
And should it be a life they give, then they will give it gladly.
Shut the fuck up.
Shall I lose Robert?
And what about you? my duty gladly.
How am I gonna watch this for three hours?
It's gonna be rough for all of us.
Shh.
Watch the play.
Did you hear the fucking idiots talking all the way through as well? was about.
Yeah, there was a woman and she took a seat that didn't belong to her.
She was a hideous hideous looking person. got a good look, Larry.
Listen, you were great.
Forget about them. You were great.
No, honestly, that's the worst I've ever been. most that was nine out of 10.
And usually I'm 10 out of 10.
Are you kidding?
I've got a beautiful feeling, everything's going my way.
You're comparing this thing we saw tonight to a Rogers and Hammerstein musical?
Poor Jud is dead.
Poor Jud is dead.
How long you got to do this play for?
Must be hard to do all that fake crying.
Where do you think they come from?
Here's where they came from.
You're not crying.
There's no tears coming out.
Come on, what'd you do?
You know what?
I'm looking at your eyes and I see no evidence at all that anybody was crying.
And did you wipe it away?
Yes I did.
And the evidence for that is in the bin on a tissue.
I picked up the ticket and they charged me $200.
You thought it'd be more? you were getting me a ticket.
I was under the impression that you were picking up the ticket, given the fact that I bought you a bottle of wine for $300.
The gift of wine.
Thank you.
And I've given you the gift of art.
Whether you give me a gift or I give you a gift, it costs me money.
Jeff, Susie.
What I especially
Do you know what, Larry?
I don't give a shit what you enjoyed about my performance.
But I really do give a shit what you talked to my husband about.
My marriage is my business.
My marriage is fine.
It has nothing to do with you.
And another thing, I fuck my husband four or five times a week.
I'm this close to signing him.
This close.
I think one more interaction
I'm good to go. that he didn't have a clue that it was us
Oh.
Hello.
How'd you get this section?
I thought you were down there.
Well, I'll be covering this section today, unless of course you want to handle it.
It's all right.
Water under the bridge.
Yeah?
That would make me happy.
What can I do for you today?
I'll get the chopped salad with the avocado.
Okay.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come here.
Come here.
Hey, there he is.
I owe you $500,
Is that cool?
Never mind that.
Just give me the $500.
He bought a bottle of wine for $300.
No, you bought me a bottle of wine and I got you into the theater.
And I paid $200
That I really didn't want to go the play in the first place.
Thank you.
Don't worry about it.
I know it was you two idiots whispering all the way through my show.
The waiter?
And you, I wouldn't let you represent me now.
Forget it.
Look at you there, two idiots.
It's like Laurel and Hardy.
Donna was right.
What?
What did you say?
No.
Huh.
Are you sure?
Okay.
No no no.
This is my favorite carriage here.
Give me your money.
Now. Come on.
Give me that.
Take 'em off.
Just give him your shoes.
Come on, face the ground.
Give it to me.
Take it off.
Give me that purse.
Give it to me.
Ah.
Drop it.
Drop it.
More?
That's it.
Yeah, get the hell out of here.
Whoa.
Yeah, well.
I believe this belongs to you, young lady. $500.
It is hard.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
No no.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
I can't even believe
It didn't even take me that long.
Are you leaving right now?
Because I don't think we should run into each other again.
It'd be great if you could get out of here.
Because if we have
Hey hey, look who it is.
What?
I met the most fantastic woman tonight.
I can't even believe it.
I felt it right away.
You know how you can feel it?
Yes. I mean, who knows what's gonna happen?
You know how lesbians are.
You know what a lesbian brings
Kids are gonna get to know her.
It's all gonna work.
I'm completely smitten.
She smiled.
And built.
A body I would like to get my hands on.
Yeah, I knew from her name.
O'Donnell, Irish, duh.
Yeah, right.
Jane Cohn?
Holy shit.
Are you kidding me?
Is this a joke?
What am I, a magician?
I know that you have a card on you?
Why would she give us both her card?
It doesn't make any sense.
What is that anyway?
I mean, pick a side already, right?
What is this?
They have to have sex with everyone?
She did not seem the type to me.
I guess you'll just have to back away because most of these women who say they're bi are really gay and they just can't say it.
Why would I back away?
This woman is crazy about me.
I came alive in areas that have been dry like the Sahara desert.
In situations like this, tie goes to the hetero.
It was no tie, babe.
She hit my base first cleanly before she even saw you.
You're intent on going through this?
Of course I am.
I don't want you to get hurt, Larry.
You've been through a lot, right?
A lot of other women here.
Probably women who are more your speed.
More your level.
Spare yourself the expense and embarrassment.
Yes, 'cause you're gonna be annihilated.
I'm gonna be annihilated by you in the love department?
She's a dyke.
Deal with it.
Ho ho. Look who's in the motherfucking house.
Ha ha. Leon in the motherfucking house.
You drove the car?
Look what you did to the car.
I was surprised.
This shit got some fucking heart to it. for that, you know what I'm saying? Fuck that.
I got eight motherfuckers up in this car.
What did you do?
You picked up hitchhikers?
See the baby seat back there?
Hell yeah.
Come on, man.
Let me see your place, man.
What are you doing here anyway?
Whoa, look at this, man.
Are you kidding me, Larry?
New York City, baby.
I'm here.
I'm in competition with Rosie O'Donnell.
I'm feeling a little insecure about it.
Lesbians have kind of an advantage in a way.
Frankly, I don't know what I'm doing down there.
Ladies know that shit.
You're right.
That's what I'm saying.
I can't compete with a lesbian like that.
They know every nook and cranny.
You know, every nook and cranny.
I couldn't be comfortable now.
I wouldn't be comfortable right now.
I'd be all fucked up.
You're goddamn right. Me too, Larry.
You know what I mean?
First of all, I would fucking throw the fuck up.
I would regurgitate my own shit.
I would regurgitate and shit.
You think I'd go out with a guy
I fucking gets mine.
You know I gets mine too.
Where's my room at?
Where the fuck's my room at, Larry?
Ha ha.
I'm in the house.
Larry?
Look at this, two Angelinos here in New York.
You know, I just came.
Hey, here's a thought.
Let's go to lunch.
I don't think so. one city all the time and we never have lunch in that city, why would we have lunch in the new city?
I see what this is.
I see what this is.
You're still holding a grudge because we didn't invite you to Joanie's Bat Mitzvah.
I'm telling you, we sent it out.
You were on the list.
Because I shouldn't have been invited in the first place.
I was offended that I was invited.
I'm gonna eat alone tomorrow.
Why do you want to eat with me?
Because we never get
Because we're not friends.
We're not friends because we never spend time together.
We don't spend time together because
I don't want to spend time together.
Is it possible that you have a little room for growth?
No. Duckstein,
I think we've taken us about as far as we can.
There will be no lunch, no breakfast or dinner.
There won't be a snack.
There won't be coffee.
There won't be a drink.
I want to make that smaller.
Shrink it.
Put the hands together.
That's what I want.
See ya, Duckstein.
Bye, Larry.
Thank you for coming over.
Yeah, ever since I met you
I can't stop puking.
I don't know what it is.
You're not the first person who's told me that.
You just have that effect on people?
I do.
Why didn't they put it in one of those bags?
The whole thing is ruined.
Get the order right, secure the food.
Usually they're good.
I don't know.
You know what?
I'm going back there and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
It's fine, 'cause actually
No, I love Sushi.
I'm just saying it's not a huge deal that I don't have it again. which you would not think is good Sushi, but it was actually really good Sushi.
I went with, um, this friend of mine.
She's very connected and we had a box to ourselves.
And they brought in catering and we had Sushi.
What did Rosie think of your apartment?
She didn't see my apartment.
Oh.
Poor thing.
Oh.
It was very distressing.
And I'm competing for her affection against a lesbian.
You didn't mention.
You talk a lot but no sandwich mentioned.
You've got to secure these bags.
Secure the bags with tape, staples, however you've got to do it.
You know what?
I really appreciate that, but that's really not quite what I had in mind.
I think an apology would be nice.
Everything okay, yeah?
Okay.
Oh.
I can't quibble with the bow.
I love that bow. Come on, how many times do you get a bow in your life?
We could learn a lot of things from Japan.
You think about on the way home.
I think, yeah.
But next time, if I come back again are you gonna beef up the security in the bag?
Everything gonna be secured for you, okay?
When you're hungry you've got
Listen, listen.
You said a deal, right?
You long explanation how special bow is.
Okay, we got it.
Next time we see you come in we make sure bag secure.
Larry David.
Look at this.
Hey, Rosie.
And you saw her when?
I won't tell her that you said that.
Did you throw your arm out?
Well, you know what?
All night long I was like in this position.
And then up from this side.
You know what I mean?
It's funny.
Usually women laugh at it.
She was too busy moaning to laugh.
What did you say?
Couldn't move my neck from Tuesday morning.
It's all right.
Listen, the thing is, she just texted me.
We're going to the Tonys together, okay? to the Tony awards.
Jane.
Me Tarzan, not you.
You could ask any stranger on the street, they'll go to the Tonys.
That's no great accomplishment.
She knows all the words to Cats, okay?
Even the British version.
She enjoyed
Chess the musical.
Saw it three times.
She saw Carrie.
It was only open two nights.
She likes Broadway, Larry.
She likes Broadway.
She's going to the Tonys?
What the hell am I gonna do?
You can't compete against the Tonys.
I'm dead.
Good play, Larry.
All right, Larry.
Two away. Two away.
Ha ha.
Come on, little Larry.
Here we go.
How's your arm?
Let's go, Larry.
I don't even have to run, Larry.
Where's he throwing the ball?
She's going home, Larry.
Oooh.
Whoo.
I don't feel like going on this date.
I swear to God, I'd like to cancel right now.
I would not be a fucking friend sitting around this plush motherfucker and allow you to go out there and allow a lesbian to beat you at a fucking game, okay?
Come on, it's over.
She's taking her to the Tonys.
And let's face it, she's got the lesbian advantage.
We are fucking men, Larry.
What do we have, man?
What the fuck do we have that she doesn't have?
I've got the penis.
You're damn right.
Women do not have penises.
Men have penises.
Don't be a fucking victim.
Okay?
You at bat.
What's below your fucking bat?
What dangles below your bat?
What do gloves do?
Catch the goddamn balls.
That's what ladies on this planet do is catch balls.
Bats and balls run the fucking world.
The woman is on this earth to catch balls.
Interesting theory.
I would like to impart that knowledge to her.
Gloves don't catch gloves.
We have the advantage.
Okay? You've got to realize that though.
Yeah yeah, I know.
I know.
But we're talking about the Tonys here, okay?
This penis that I have cannot compete with the Tonys.
Fucking Tony.
Who the fuck is Tony?
Want a grand slam?
Hmm.
Juice?
You want me to juice?
I want you to win.
That was amazing.
And it's not just
That's what you get on a consistent basis with me.
Shall we do this again on Friday?
I don't want to wait that long.
Wow.
Too bad for that person.
All right, Janie.
It's been swell.
Hope you had fun.
Ah.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?
Yes, I am fluent.
Almost 90°.
Now the other night a Japanese fellow apologized to me.
That is not apology to you.
He a little dismissive of you.
Shit bow.
Little insulting to you.
Not a bow like that.
Thank you very much.
This has been very helpful to me.
Thank you, yes.
Very good.
How you doing, Lar?
I guess you heard.
I've known like four decades of women that you've dated.
None of them ever ever talks about your performance.
You're a singles hitter your whole life, now all of a sudden you're Mr power hitter?
You're Mr grand slam? Mr get anybody, even Jane, huh?
What do you do?
I'm on a new regiment.
I'm working out.
I've changed my diet.
Makes a big difference.
What, are you juicing, Larry?
I have never taken performance enhancing drugs ever.
Period.
No no no no no no no.
Got it.
But it doesn't make sense, Larry.
Outfield in.
Play to first.
All right, let's go, Larry.
Easy out.
He's in the hospital, but they say he's gonna be fine.
You know how to do the heimlich.
You could have, you know.
Yeah, I know how to do the heimlich.
You do. If you only went to lunch with him.
Yeah, you're right.
I could have helped him.
She loves baseball.
She blew off the Tonys with Rosie.
It's not like being with a guy.
It's like being with a great guy who happens to have a vagina and knows the statistics of what Roy White hit in 1971.
And I beat Rosie.
Should be ready in a second.
Hello.
I got the stapler, tape.
Look at this.
Can I turn it upside down?
Wow.
You secure
You know, there is one more little issue
I just wanted to mention.
I was in the park and there was a Japanese fellow and I saw him bowing, but he bowed to 90°.
Your bow was like 15°.
Sure yeah, thank you.
Listen, a bow is a bow, right?
No, he said a bow is not a bow.
You were short of the authentic bow.
I had authentic bow.
Bow is a bow.
He is not authentic.
He doesn't know.
Is it possible you don't know the bow rules?
Bow rules?
I understand the bow rules. because a bow is a bow.
Do you know what the Japanese guy in the park actually said about your bow?
No, what did he say?
It's a shit bow.
He said shit bow?
Yes, those were his words.
Shit bow.
My bow is a shit bow?
I'm not saying that.
Let's find out.
I'll go on the Internet, we'll do a little research, then I'll come back and we'll see if your bow is right.
Okay, sure.
I do that for you.
There's good places here.
That looked good.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, research.
I'm living large.
I just had a croissant filled with motherfucking champagne.
Hey, I've got to talk to you.
Hold the fuck on, bitch.
Hold the fuck up. God damn.
Supplement.
A supplement?
What the fuck is that?
You know, one of the pills.
I don't have no pills.
I'm out. You're popping these motherfuckers like candy.
She'll notice the drop off.
How am I gonna do that?
Yeah, that's fucked up.
You can't go into a fuck fight with no goddamn weapon.
That ain't cool.
Fucking walking in with a goddamn jump rope hanging from your fucking pants.
Get off the phone.
Who are you talking to?
Can you think of anything?
Here's what I want you to do, okay?
Go around to Washington
Square park, all right?
Got any of that stuff?
The money.
Come on.
Yeah.
Come on, Jane.
What are you doing?
Give me a test.
Wrong. Manny.
What is this?
Are you juicing?
No no.
Look, it's not for performance.
No, seriously.
Are you kidding?
You think anybody else could do what I do just by taking one of those pills?
I have skills.
Hey, what are you doing?
Where's my ticket?
Everybody's doing it.
I was just leveling the playing field.
I really felt terrible
Forget it. You know why?
Because the important thing is whatever brought you here is now the beginning of a friendship.
Lunch time.
What do we have today?
Salisbury steak.
This could be our first meal together.
We're having lunch after all.
Talk about destiny.
I feel it, I know you feel it.
This is gonna be the first of God knows how many lunches.
Because this is the beginning.
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?
I'm standing here.
You don't stand there like a cab gas.
That's etiquette.
Come on, come on.
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it, you got it.
All right.
We'll do 30 seconds and one more.
You said one more,
I did one more.
Okay, all right.
How is your shoulder?
This new trainer, completely cured me.
He massages it, he gives you exercises for it.
I don't like trainers, not into them.
I don't like being told what to do.
Yeah, right.
That's why you married Susie?
Cause she doesn't tell you what to do.
All right, I got the point.
I got the point.
No wonder why you don't like being told what to do.
I stink.
We really gotta get going, man.
Where the hell are you taking me?
I'm taking you to an inventor.
What do they invent?
My cousin, all his friends say this guy is brilliant.
I have a million ideas for things.
That doesn't mean you're an inventor.
A ski that comes in two pieces.
You screw it on, okay?
Okay, you're an idea man.
Go with me on that one.
You're an idea man.
I'm an idea man who comes up with inventions.
No, there are no inventions in your world.
Well, that's an invention.
The ski that comes in two pieces is an invention.
Well, we have a difference of opinion on implementation.
All right, we gotta get going.
Literally a couple more balls and then we gotta go to the inventor.
The mirrors, which are
There's a mirror on the bottom and a mirror on the top, right?
That's how it works.
You push a button in the car and it comes right up.
I've actually thought of that.
I swear.
I've been in cars
I'm stuck in traffic and I'm thinking there should be a periscope.
Yeah, I honestly did.
It's a great idea.
I mean, kind of like this that
I'd mounted in my own Volvo.
I mean, I'd love for you
But what I'm looking to raise money for is this.
Here we have a fully articulated antenna, okay?
It's locked up into the car.
You push a button on the dashboard.
It comes up.
Then a camera at the top sends a live image to a screen, onto the dashboard, just like if you put the car in
Of course.
This periscope is going to be on every single car in the world.
Everyone wants to see where the traffic is.
Everyone wants to see what's going on ahead of them.
Remember these?
Do you know a kid once stabbed me in class?
With the pencil side, thank God.
I wouldn't be here looking at your invention.
You know what? I could make circles for, like, four hours.
That's basically it.
You know, when people go skiing,
What do you think?
But that's not really an invention.
Where do we come in on this?
Excuse me one second.
Well, you know what?
It's a great idea, but really who is this guy?
Why should we trust him?
This could be a big, elaborate con game for all we know.
You think it could be a con game?
You know, look at The Sting.  That's elaborate.
I never saw it.
I saw The Sting II.
You didn't see The Sting?
What kind of idiot sees
Sting II and not Sting I?
I don't remember back then, but I'm just telling you
I didn't see Sting I.
I saw Sting II.
All right, look, here's what we'll tell him,
We'll think about it.
Yes? Good good.
Thank you.
Yeah, we're gonna be thinking about it.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Bye.
Any questions I had about this guy were just answered.
Without a doubt.
He's smart.
He can have anybody.
He chose her.
That tells you everything you need to know.
This guy's got integrity.
I trust him now.
You know what? couple of schmucks, science experiment, this thing.
That's what it looks like.
No, there's gonna be an antenna with a camera attached and you'll see it on the screen in the front.
Yeah, and how much money is that gonna cost?
I don't know.
Standstill traffic.
What's all this?
Oh.
We've got a garbage truck at 12,00.
You go to your left.
Go to your left.
I see the garbage truck.
Unbelievable. Wow.
I'm willing to admit I'm wrong.
This might really be a real thing.
That was unbelievable.
It's like a treat.
No no, I'm here because
But now New York is haunted.
And you look fantastic, by the way.
I couldn't even hold a glass a few weeks ago 'cause of my elbow.
He fixed my elbow. He fixed my shoulder.
The guy's great.
Why don't you send me his information?
I will.
I will email it to you.
I'm still at the same
I'm gonna go mingle.
Well, that'd be a nice thing for you to do.
I happen to be in top physical shape.
Well, you know, he's getting up there.
I actually moved him in with me.
That was my favorite show.
I used to race home to watch that.
I would laugh for hours about him
You're not prepared, young lady.
Where are the pictures?
Judge Horn, wow.
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for stopping by.
You know what? I should go say hello to him, shouldn't I?
Yeah, that would be nice.
I always think of nice things but I never act on them.
What is that?
It's like you with inventions,
You never do the inventions.
I could do it right now.
By God, I'm gonna go into that room and do it.
He has to announce it.
Woman.
Double letters go for the w.
Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,
Hey.
Judge Horn.
Yeah.
Larry David.
There you go.
How are you doing?
People are confused when they
Yeah yeah.
Hey, could you do me a favor, Larry?
I appreciate it, Larry.
All right, fine.
I'll play a little scrabble.
Yeah.
My father was a huge huge fan of yours.
He used to watch you all the time.
A lot of kikes liked the show jigaboos too.
What's the matter?
Are you not gonna play?
Are you all right?
What's going on?
May I talk to you outside for a second?
What a great pleasure to meet you.
Outside the room.
How could you do that?
Do what?
Taking advantage of my father at scrabble?
I didn't play him.
I wasn't playing him. playing him.
Yes, he had a work uniform like he was fixing an air conditioner.
Larry, Larry,
I'm having a party.
We don't have any maintenance people up here doing work.
Excuse me, did you see
No.
There was
Larry, there's no
Look, you took advantage of my father, okay?
What, they're saying these things because they're drunk? No, it's in there.
Larry, I'm not gonna listen to this anymore, all right?
A game he loves, okay?
I didn't beat him.
You know what? and I'm gonna bring him to you.
You'll see.
You'll see. playing scrabble with a racist judge?
It's not racism.
It's dementia.
All right, now get to your left a little bit.
Yeah, Henry's using the dementia as an excuse for the racism.
I know. My grandfather had dementia.
He wasn't a racist.
He thought I was his dead sister, but he wasn't a racist.
Did you look like
I swear to God,
She was the belle of Brighton.
I mean, it's unbelievable.
Three blocks ahead I see we're heading for trouble.
Three blocks ahead there's a guy with his truck.
I swear to God.
He's crossing the street.
Check it out.
I see one arm. Are you sure
I want to track him down.
Stay in the right lane.
Damn it, where is he?
Right down there.
I can't turn down that block.
All right, go down.
We'll make a right.
We'll head him off at the pass.
All right, make a right.
Make a right.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
This is it.
This is the block.
It's him. Hey, look out.
Wait, hey.
He went down to the subway.
Shit.
Hello.
But I'll see you tomorrow at 2,00.
I have a 2,00. I don't get it.
What are we working out?
I gotta run.
Take care. Bye.
Larry, as your business manager,
I cannot advocate you putting your money into this.
It's nutty.
I don't like my clients to invest in inventions.
He threw away millions come together like a pool cue.
Are you serious? That's my idea.
I had that idea.
People's legs would snap like that.
I don't think so.
They could perfect that.
And you'd be carrying it like a pool cue.
I mean, I love your exuberance and your enthusiasm for inventions, but it shows that in this area your judgment is not good.
I believe in this inventor.
Why?
Have you done a background check?
Yeah, send her in, sure.
Larry, nice to meet you.
I'm just coming by to make sure that you're okay for the Hamptons.
Nice to meet you.
That's your wife?
I don't think we can work together anymore.
What are you talking about? Why?
She's beautiful.
Yes, thank you.
I don't like what that says about you.
What does it say about me?
It says I have good judgment.
It says you're a very superficial man.
You can't Judge me because
I have a beautiful wife.
Eh, I think I can.
I can't trust you with my money.
I'll be in touch. it didn't work out.
Very moist.
I don't want to be pushy or anything like that, but I know that you drove the car and I just wanted to know how you felt about it.
All right. you are the first inventor
I've ever handed a check to?
We love it.
We just love it.
I'm gonna get him into the prototype, get him his keys back.
All right?
We'll be back.
Well, not now.
We could get you another one.
I'll pay for it if you want.
I did order it.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Why don't you go meet up with them?
Hey hey.
Bye.
Bye.
She seems lovely.
She is the best.
I can tell.
I'm gonna marry her if she'll have me.
Henry, I like myself when I'm with her.
And I can see now you are a man of great character.
You got that right.
I just would like to apologize for my behavior at the party.
Henry, I don't mind telling you it stung.
Are we all right?
We're fine. We're cool.
Anything else?
I was wondering if I could ask you to do me a huge favor.
Sure.
My dad goes to the park every day to play scrabble.
Five and two is seven.
Had? That's all you
I guess I'm just not a very good player.
I'm just not that good.
Coon?
Coon.
Okay, that's not a word, all right?
That's a racial epithet.
Just look around you.
They're all over the park.
We're surrounded, and after I put half of them away.
Okay, Judge.
You know what?
I'm gonna give you coon.
That's big of you.
I'm ready.
I'm waiting.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing, Terry? a little awkward.
We're working out.
He's great.
This is my time.
Who would you rather run around the park with, huh?
This is my time, Wanda.
This is not your time.
Why don't you guys figure this out?
Let me know what you decide.
Why are you imposing on my time right here?
Imposing on your time?
I recommended him to you.
Larry, 2,00 is my only open time.
It's my only open time too.
I don't know what to do here, okay?
We're clearly at an impasse here.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
What do you want to do?
He's an impartial third party.
Why don't we let him decide?
He's neutral.
Yeah, let's do it.
Whatever he decides we'll abide by.
Yeah, he's a Judge.
Okay.
No, don't worry about Wanda, Terry. worked things out.
Good.
Thank you.
All right,
Yeah, tomorrow 2,00.
Look forward to it.
Okay.
I will get the hell out of here if I see any touching at all.
I can't wait to see this movie.
It's gonna be great.
Yeah.
I'm gonna use the bathroom before the movie.
I'll hold your popcorn.
Eh, not necessary.
It's no problem. You want to go to the bathroom.
I'll hold your popcorn for you.
No no, I'll just take it into the bathroom. It's fine.
You're gonna take your popcorn into the bathroom?
That's disgusting.
Don't leave your popcorn in the bathroom.
The people and the
No no no, I hold on to it.
Yeah, I like to munch and pee.
No, there's a little bit of a problem there.
Look, it's my popcorn.
It's not necessary.
You don't want me to hold the popcorn, right?
Because what, you think
I'm gonna eat your popcorn?
Eat my popcorn?
Are you worried she's gonna eat your popcorn?
Obviously.
Obviously?
What's that?
What the fuck does that mean?
No, only that, you know,
Hold this.
Here, you can hold it.
Hold it.
Take the popcorn.
Here, take it.
I don't want it.
Take it.
Arghh.
I'm seeing a few more.
All right.
Well, listen,
I just wanted to give you a little bit of an idea of what it's like to invest with me.
I find myself saying it's
It's a car periscope.
That's not gonna work.
I can't do it.
Ask around.
But as you make the rounds, as you make the rounds,
I just want you to definitely definitely definitely keep us in mind.
That's your wife? 20 years.
You're hired.
Hey. Hey.
I've been looking for you.
You got me in a lot of trouble with that scrabble game.
What are you talking about?
What were you doing in that apartment anyway?
None of your fucking business.
Hey, what are you doing?
I was here first.
Are you upstreaming me?
You can't upstream me.
What are you doing?
Get out of here. Taxi.
Taxi.
That's my cab, buddy.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Get your own cab.
Dad.
Dad.
Who did this to you? dirt on their food here?
You know, these buses come by.
Everybody makes such a big deal about eating outside.
Hey, do me a favor and remind me to pick up my glove later.
You're wearing gloves?
They're in a league.
Is that what you call it?
We're playing for the championship.
Are you not listening anything
I've ever told you? than the golf championship.
No, I don't like baseball.
You I can understand. You've been married a long time.
You could care less about what he does.
And when you first start dating you always do things that are distasteful.
Okay, how about I give that to you?
And chicken.
Enjoy.
I'm gonna keep the chicken.
You can't keep the chicken.
We said we're gonna split it.
I only chose it because I knew we were gonna split it.
Look, you brought the fish into it.
I'm saying no. this is why he's a good manager.
You should be thankful he's unethical.
He's unscrupulous.
I'm not even joking.
That's where you're wrong.
I'm just sharing.
I know for a fact you did not learn a lesson.
I have to go.
I have a piano lesson.
Good luck at your wiffle ball game or whatever.
She likes you, which is a shocking thing to me.
Larry, favor.
Jeff's birthday is coming up.
There's a signing thing at the Regency.
I need you to get this signed as a gift.
Can you do that for me?
Lar. Lar.
Larry.
What happened? Where'd you go?
What's the point of the whole thing?
To tell you the truth, whenever
I see a woman who's happy, she's married.
And whenever I see a man who's happy, he's single.
When I was a kid
Two, three, four, five.
All right, Larry, what do you got?
I've got two pair.
Wow, that's pretty good.
But not good enough.
I've got a flush.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, come on, take it off.
Come on.
That's pretty pretty pretty good.
What the hell are you doing with my daughter?
Come here.
He's got more pubes on his fucking head.
What the fuck are you doing, kid?
You know what I'm talking about?
It's deeply disturbing, there's no question about it.
But let me just make sure
I understand.
Yes. Do you mind if I put my feet up here?
Well, I think even if it were a dress shoe I would be fine.
You're not gonna resent me when I leave here for putting my feet up and putting you in this compromising position?
I don't feel funny about it.
But if it makes you feel better
This was a girl that you knew from the neighborhood, I presume.
And of course I lost almost every hand.
I feel like if she had taken the top off my whole life would have been different.
Keep it going. Keep it going, guys.
Come on.
Easy job.
Be ready tomorrow like I said, okay?
Championship game.
Bring it in, everybody.
Come on.
Okay, we're here.
We made it.
We made it to the big game.
Center stage.
Every one of you all, give yourselves a clap on the hand.
You know, before I came out today
I think about I'm like the Steinbrenner.
And I think, What would
Steinbrenner say right now?
He would say that when you put on this uniform with my name on it, there is no substitute for winning.
No substitute.
We aren't just going to beat them, we will grab them and we will fuck their sisters in the cunt.
Are you listening?
Bring it in.
Come on.
Yes.
Fuck their sisters in the cunt?
Who talks that way?
Okay, here we go.
Two outs.
One more out, all right?
Ground ball goes to first, second or third or home.
All right, come on, Yari.
Yes.
You got it, Larry.
What the fuck? What?
And now they're going home.
Where are you?
What happened?
A baby could have kicked that ball,
You fucking bucknered it.
God damn, Larry.
I told you that. with two outs that cost us the championship.
Meanwhile I'm standing the fuck out here counting my motherfucking nuts.
Know why?
I can't get in the goddamn building.
This dude right here. The gatekeeper won't let me in the goddamn building.
Let me just say this, okay?
On behalf of all Caucasians,
I apologize for the Caucasian race.
By the way, I have a very good idea for you.
To avoid situations like this in the future,
I think you should consider wearing glasses.
I have noticed that white people revere black people in glasses, go out of their way to do stuff for them.
If a black man with glasses goes up for a job against a white man, glasses gets the job.
Larry, what's the problem?
Well, come on,
It's not ready?
How come it's not ready?
Half ready.
What happened?
I guess I made an error.
Yeah. because I made an error?
What are you, 12 years old?
What are you, 90 years old?
You let the ball go through your legs.
Too too too tot.
You don't understand because you're not the Steinbrenner.
Steinbrenner owned a major league baseball team.
I paid for them.
Yari's autonomics. you disgraced my business.
He says winning all day, every day or go away.
Take your car.
Take your fucking car.
Here is your key.
Here is your key.
I never want to see you or your key wearing my name on your shirt again.
I won't wear your name on my shirt again, that's a promise.
Get out.
Buckner, fuck you.
Go Buckner yourself.
I don't know what he did to it.
The front seat is really rattling.
It's terrible.
Hold up, hold up.
Let me go down here and give it a shot, man.
Wow.
We're good.
I'm gonna get me a whole new class of bitches with these on.
Wow, this is amazing.
It worked.
This is better than anything the civil rights leaders have ever come up with.
You're goddamn right.
I have overcome, God damn it.
I got to get Mookie's autograph.
I'm gonna check out
Joe Pepitone over here.
What's up, man?
Hey, Dr. Thurgood.
You're getting Mookie's autograph, huh?
Yeah well,
I'm usually a Cubs fan.
I'm kind of attracted to the hopeless cases.
Hey, right?
Well, listen, I hope you'll excuse me.
You understand?
Larry, I don't live in school either.
You know what I mean?
Nice to see you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What happened was
I mean, while we're here?
What's the big deal?
We're just on line. So, and then that night
I had a client once, he was a rock guitarist.
He played for the band, what was the name of it?
Grand Funk Railroad. I don't
I already told you he played for Grand Funk Railroad.
You can just look it up.
It's Mark Farner.
The great thing about Mark Farner was he didn't mess around with all the extraneous notes.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I find it a little troubling that you told me his name, because now you could be telling people my name.
It was merely an accident.
Well, I don't want this accident to happen with me.
I completely understand. And I don't think it will happen with your name.
I would never do that to you or any other patient, Larry.
Excuse me one second.
I think that's Bill Buckner.
Wow.
I can't believe it.
Of course yours happened in the world series in front of millions of people, but nevertheless a ball went through my legs and cost us the game.
How did you deal with all that stuff?
You know, when you're giving your best effort, it's a team game, those things happen.
You've just got to forget about it.
Jeez, you have a really good attitude.
I'd love to talk to you about this.
Do you got a minute?
Michael Jordan had a Hitler mustache.
Yeah, I saw that. He's the first one to wear that since Hitler, isn't he?
You know what?
I think that's true.
Nice catch.
You just get used to it.
Hey, don't worry about it, Larry.
You want to go take in a couple of Broadway shows?
There's a good one called Next to Normal
I hear a lot of good stuff about.
Could I interrupt you?
I've got an emergency.
Are either of you gentlemen Jewish?
Listen, I have a problem upstairs.
We're doing a kaddish and we need one more guy to fill out the Minyan.
You could have a little sandwich while you're watching.
We've got to get to the cemetery.
What do you think?
Have you ever had
Jewish food before?
A nice Jewish gentleman has volunteered.
Excuse me.
What?
Hopefully there's an afterlife.
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
You never know.
Crazier things, right?
Are you Bill Buckner?
I'll have to ask you to please leave.
Larry, don't worry about it. Hey.
Don't let the door go through your legs on the way out, Buckner. your life before you leave.
Hey, you won two world championships since then. That's not enough for you? to be in your stupid Minyan anyway.
I hope there is no afterlife.
I hope there's no afterlife.
To hell with the kishka.
Come on.
Hey. Friend of mine.
You might know him.
Yeah, a little bit with the Angels.
Angels too?
How about that?
We met at a baseball card show.
What were you doing at a baseball card show?
What was I doing?
Do you have the most thoughtful wife in the world? if I didn't go to the show.
Larry, what the hell were you doing?
Hey, Buck, come on.
It was a good throw. You bobbled it.
Get out, both of you.
You ruined the gift.
Come on, it was in your hands.
How could you miss that ball? Are you serious?
I thought you were a baseball player.
Fantastic.
Tonight I'm gonna bring it.
The only problem is the car.
I just got it out of the shop and it wasn't fixed.
I actually think I'm going
I'll put the TV on. We'll start watching TV as if we're gonna watch TV.
But I'm really gonna try and put moves on you while we're watching TV.
You're not allowed to just say, Hey, let's have sex.
It's sleight of hand.
The TV kind of diverts your attention from what the real agenda is.
Although, does it really?
I mean, you know and I know.
I don't know why we have to go through this charade.
Anyway, I don't know.
People like a mixed nut.
Are you kidding me with the pineapple?
It doesn't blend well with the mixed nuts.
The dried pineapple is destroying mixed nuts.
What about a dip?
Ho ho ho.
This is my lucky day.
Unbelievable.
Would you mind driving me home?
What?
I'm kind of done.
I think I need to call it a night.
Why? I thought you were gonna come upstairs.
I'm just kind of ready for bed, you know?
Like for golf, when I have a bad round, my next round is fantastic because I don't care anymore.
I hit the low point.
Like, I hit the low point the last time.
And now I know that I stink.
And when I feel I stink I'm good.
Well, let's go for it another night.
No man would ever change his mind,
I'll tell you that.
I'm very curious to know why she would do that.
Why? I'll tell you why. Because when you're impotent, women treat you like a leper.
You tried to put a noodle in a woman?
Women hate that, man.
That's a remarkably idiotic thing that you just said.
But you know, the fact that you're wearing glasses,
I perceive it as a little less idiotic than I normally would.
Huh?
What the hell is this?
A bill from the therapist?
I think he charged me for talking to him at the card show.
Mmm.
Mmm.
What's with you?
You know what?
I think I figured this shit out.
She was getting her rocks off in this damn chair.
This shit is a moving dildo.
Man cannot compete with machinery.
No wonder why she didn't come upstairs.
You're damn right.
She was coming downstairs.
Whatever the fuck you do, you keep her out of this damn car.
You know what this car is?
This car is the other fucking man.
She is cheating on you with this fucking chair.
I know I don't have an appointment now, but I got a bill in the mail today.
Am I to understand that you charged me for talking to me on line at the baseball card show?
Dr. Thurgood, we spoke for all of three minutes.
Are you saying I'm a narcissist?
Larry, maybe I can help you understand this way.
I had a client. He was quite an illustrious
I don't want to reveal who he was, but he did direct Star Wars.
And he enjoyed in his repertoire of things that he liked to see prostitutes.
Now in that particular situation, if he were to hire a prostitute, let's say for an hour,
I mean, that's who directed Star Wars.
Well, I would never say that.
I merely alluded to the fact that
Now one of the things that he
Everybody knows who directed Star Wars.
Not everyone is in show business, Larry.
I didn't ask about George Lucas but you just brought him up.
And here's my point.
He used to frequent prostitutes.
And very often he would hire them for an hour, which was their minimum, but it only took him three or four or maybe five minutes to complete the shot, if you understand what I'm saying.
However, they considered it fair and he considered it fair to pay them for the full hour.
That was the way they did business.
First off, I'm appalled by what you just said to me.
He has a right to do what he wants.
He's an adult.
It's supposed to be confidential.
It's merely by way of illustration.
My point is that people need various things to help them function.
And my hope was that
I was doing that for you.
Well, it's good to see you.
Yes, and congratulations, doctor.
Okay.
Whew.
You know what?
Let me go in and give it a shot with the glasses on.
I really don't think it's gonna work.
Give me that bill, man.
Fucking around.
Dr. Thurgood, allow me to introduce myself.
Mr Black, really a pleasure to meet you.
He tore the bill up, threw it in the garbage. Done.
Yeah, on top of that shit, check it out.
How about that?
Give that to Jeff now.
Replace the ball you lost.
See how it works? Ooh.
I need a ride.
I don't want the fucking ball now.
I need a ride.
My cousin's building is on fire.
Can you believe this?
It's over by the Regency on Park.
Yeah, I need a ride over to my cousin's building. It's on fire.
Larry, drive me.
Just give me a fucking ride, okay?
The building's on fire, Larry.
Please, come on. Hurry up.
I need to get over there.
What don't you understand about fire?
Give me a fucking ride.
What's the matter?
Why can't you give me a goddamn ride?
Sit in the back seat.
I'll give you a limo ride.
Larry, I don't want a fucking limousine.
Just open the fucking door.
I'm hysterical.
Don't you see that?
I can't drive.
I can't focus.
Make such a big fucking deal.
I ask for a little ride across town.
What? What are you waiting for?
Why are you driving like a snail?
No. No.
No.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Asshole.
Jesus, what the hell is going on over here?
Looks like quite a fire.
My hotel is just right down the street and I was going for a little walk.
Please help me.
My baby.
Come on, come on.
I can't believe it.
Unbelievable.
I've never seen anything like that in my life.
Yeah.
Hey, all right.
You know what I'd like to do now?
Go for a really long drive.
I need five minutes.
Welcome, designers.
You've heard the expression she'd even look great in a potato sack?
A great pleasure to meet you.
That's a Hitler mustache.
That's Hitler hair. really care for Jews.
He thought they were a bit much.
I would kick his butt.
Good for you.
Project Runway.
The fashion.
It's like the best show ever.
Hmm.
I like how the lines just go straight and then up and then down and then straight and then up and then down.
It's beautiful.
I'll have to think about that.
They should start selling them in every gift shop in New York City.
I don't think
Jews would like that.
Get a life, Jews.
Hmm. Yeah.
Okay, sweetie,
Nana's waiting for you.
Oh.
Eh, I don't know.
Hey. Shh.
Come on.
A pianist is playing up there.
Unbelievable.
How are you doing? My assistant called.
Table for three.
You live downstairs.
You got the place downstairs.
Yeah yeah, shh.
It's background music.
Yeah, I know, but still, just try and keep it down.
It's not Carnegie Hall.
It's just a bar.
See ya later.
What were you saying about the frog?
There was an inflatable frog that came out of a French restaurant in Vegas.
You're getting one of those foofy drinks, right?
No, I'm gonna go with straight Tequila.
Hey, Fox.
Fox. Fox.
Shh.
Come on.
Yeah, clap.
I don't know how you do it.
I really don't.
It's atmosphere.
It's a nice setting.
Quite a young man.
He's really like one of my favorite people in the world, obviously.
You know, I signed up for single motherhood. part of the deal, you know.
Flamboyant.
I think the fact that he can
I don't know where he gets it.
There's nobody like him.
It makes him really special and unique and different.
Okay.
His birthday's next week.
We're probably gonna have a party.
You're welcome to come.
Probably just like a little family thing.
Nah, I'm not that guy.
I guess it'd be kind of boring.
I'll buy him a birthday gift.
How about that?
Then I get him a present.
What's the debate?
Of course,
What do you get a kid like that?
He loves everything.
You met him.
Can't get him a baseball.
Sure you can.
Don't worry about it.
Just get him whatever.
Yes. See that kind of head shake he just gave me?
He's upset because
I shushed him earlier.
You know he has a condition.
I don't know.
I don't think that it's the kind of question that you can ask him.
No. He lives right upstairs from me.
Maybe just say
Yeah, okay.
Good idea.
It's just, you know, you hit two floors and I'm in a little bit of a rush, that's all.
What a terrible inconvenience.
Well, as a matter of fact it is a little bit of an inconvenience, yes.
You don't know where I'm going.
I'm in a little bit of a rush.
I didn't mean to waste 12 seconds of your precious time.
It's about the fact that you hit two buttons.
Who doesn't know what floor they're getting off on?
I realize that that's illegal in your little world, isn't it?
When you realized you'd hit the wrong floor,
You mean because
Why don't you go to 40?
There you go.
Now you're going to 40 as well.
You wanna go to 33, 34?
All right.
I changed my mind.
Terrific.
Now we're going to every floor.
Yeah, enjoy that ride up to 44. here and take the stairs.
Enjoy the walk. wanted to tell you that I hope you weren't upset about the shushing, because a lot
Nobody likes to be shushed.
Yeah, nobody likes to be shushed.
Yeah, it wasn't a Larry's shake.
Got it. Okay.
But she was playing background music.
It was not a performance.
I mean, per se.
To me it's a little rude.
If I went to see one of your movies and I was talking, you probably wouldn't like it.
I'd be surprised.
Where are you gonna see one of my movies?
It was like 1985 last time I was in a movie.
Okay, if I saw one of your movies in 1985, you wouldn't like it if I was talking.
This is getting into time travel.
I'll be back in two shakes.
What the fuck?
Yeah, he's a businessman.
He's on businessweek magazine.
You're kidding. What the hell is he doing on the cover of a magazine?
I just like to see what people look like with Hitler mustaches.
He looks like Hitler.
I've gotta get rid of this because he's coming over here.
That's all right.
That'd be great.
You know, I mean, the thing is
Hitler really ruined that mustache for everybody.
Did you shake that up on purpose?
I think the shirt's ruined.
I'm not really surprised, man.
He would never do anything like that on purpose.
Michael J. Fox?
Never in a million years.
But he shakes, right?
He can't stop fuckin' shaking.
See that fuckin' milk you got in your hand right now?
You hand that man a carton of
Thank God he didn't hand you his dick.
He could've been shaking and shook that dick up, handed you the dick, and the dick shot sperm in your face.
Yeah, but why would he hand me a dick?
I'm just comparing it to other things you can shake up, right?
What's that?
Hey, Greg.
Happy Birthday.
What is it?
It's a sewing machine.
It's a sewing machine.
Meet me in St. Louis, the wizard of oz.
I love it, I love it,
I love it.
Thank you, lord?
Thank you, Larry.
What, are you trying to turn him gay?
He is a happy, healthy,
What is the matter with you?
I think he might be gay.
Leon. You up?
Yeah, I'm up.
This dude is out of fucking control right now.
What is going on with him?
All this fuckin' clomping around all fuckin' night?
You'd better hound this dude, man.
You'd better go up there and handle this fuckin' guy.
This shit don't go down in a black neighborhood.
You know what I mean?
All right, I'm gonna go up there.
Unless you want to.
If I go up there, I will kill this motherfucker.
Michael J. Fox about to be Michael J.
But if you go up there,
That's a fair fight and shit.
Shaking motherfuckers like that, you know, little kids and shit, old people, motherfuckers who can't
That's perfect.
That's just even Steven.
You don't think I can get the better of him in a fight?
That shaking shit might come in handy.
I don't fuckin' know.
Right? You don't know this motherfucker's skills.
All right, you watch me, okay?
This shit don't happen in a black neighborhood.
What's going on up here?
Why? What do you mean what's going on?
There's a lot of clomping on the floor.
Yeah yeah.
My feet cramp.
It's called dystonia and I have to wear stiff shoes to keep them from cramping.
It's in my book. It's chapter one.
You should read it.
At the very least it'll help you get to sleep.
Your feet are cramping?
Is this a new thing?
You haven't lived here.
You've lived in California.
I've been living here for over a month.
I haven't heard any clomping.
I'll tell you what I think.
You wanna know what I think, Fox?
I think you're upset about the shushing.
I think you were pissed off about the
That's what I think.
Huh?
I thought I was the sickest guy on this block, but you're the new champ.
I have a sickness in my brain.
You have a sickness in your mind.
Are you sure?
Yeah, Larry, I'm dead certain.
Okay.
You give as a gift?
No, not inappropriate.
He loved the gift.
He went in that room, figured out in two minutes how to work that sewing machine.
And he was working on a frilly thing immediately.
I don't like the implication, all right?
He's too young to be attracted to anybody.
He will be gay.
I think it was an insult and I think you'd better get another fucking gift, okay?
Why does she stick her nose into everything?
What, I gotta get the kid another gift now?
Nah, that's got the ice skating thing.
You don't wanna even touch that.
No sexuality involved unless you get him a harp.
You wanna keep away from the flute, I think.
Seriously, I'm not thinking straight. clomping around upstairs.
She's a saint.
What a relationship those two have, huh?
I know.
You're right.
As a cynic it kind of sickens me, but he'd take a bullet for her.
He would take a bullet for her.
Would you take a bullet for me?
Of course I'd take a bullet for you.
What, are you kidding?
Without a doubt.
I doubt it.
Get the fuck out.
I'm going home.
See you, folks.
Real good. Thanks for the Yankees tickets.
By the way, still a lot of clomping I'm hearing.
Mr Fox, is there a problem here?
As a matter of fact, there is a bit of a problem.
You need me to call the police?
Eddie, get Mr
Fox a cab, please. Thank you.
What's the problem?
I'll tell you what the problem is.
He's using it to harass me, okay?
I swear to God.
I don't give a shit.
But you don't touch Mr Fox.
Do you understand?
He's banging on my ceiling with these special shoes.
He's wearing combat boots.
And yesterday he shoved me when I was coming out of the elevator.
Shoved me.
Michael J. Fox shoved me, okay?
Don't you understand what he's doing?
Nobody understands this.
You think he would like what he's seeing here?
Mr David,
I'd like to ask you about the incident in the elevator.
That guy told you about that?
Give me a break.
Mr David, you're not allowed to play with the buttons on the elevator.
I didn't play with the buttons.
He played with the buttons.
Mr David, I'm afraid it's the decision of this board, in view of the two offenses, that you are on probation.
I think I don't have to explain that a third offense will mean you will be asked to leave the building.
It's not fair.
Well, perhaps you could make amends to Mr Fox.
He's holding a fundraiser tomorrow afternoon in our courtyard and it would be a good thing if you showed up.
How much are you thinking? $10,000.
Hey, look at that.
It's another present for Greg. like any great leader,
I responded.
Well, that's really none of your business. of my business?
I wanna know if you've fucked up again.
I got a good gift and I'd like to surprise him, if you don't mind.
He could be surprised.
We don't need to be surprised, okay?
Yeah, I don't wanna be surprised, Larry.
That sewing machine's gotta go.
Yeah. I'll box it up.
I'll give it back to you.
I don't want it.
What am I gonna do with it?
You make such a big megillah over everything.
I'm a megillah?
Why am I a megillah?
I have to buy two gifts now and take one back?
And be gone with you.
Asshole.
Greg.
Come here, honey.
Look who's here.
It's Larry.
Larry got you a present to replace the sewing machine.
A pillow sham.
He made you a pillow sham.
What? Where did you learn about this symbol?
Larry taught me how to make a swastika.
He wrote it on a piece of paper.
Who hated Jews.
Hitler.
Yeah, Hitler.
You think this is an appropriate symbol
Ahh.
Are you okay?
Honey, are you okay?
I took a bullet for you.
Well, it was a bike technically.
Good afternoon.
It's really great to see you.
How are you feeling?
Well, I got a doctor's appointment this afternoon.
I'll get the whole thing straightened out. we have to tackle road blocks
Larry, what are you doing?
Why do you have to come here and do that?
Give the violin sign in front of all these people?
He made the violin sign?
I got a kid a present.
It was a present.
The violin sign, Larry.
Come on, please.
Wait a second, Mike.
Let me handle this. I'm the mayor.
I'm not gonna stand here and listen to anybody denigrate Michael J. Fox.
He's a great new yorker and a great American.
This guy is trying to put
I'm a new yorker.
You can't do that to me.
I'm a new yorker.
Now listen, there is a small amount of internal bleeding.
It's small.
We're gonna handle it.
And considering the area of the injury,
You know, I really owe you an apology.
I wasn't mocking you with the violin.
I bought a violin for this little kid.
I couldn't say it out loud because
It's over. Forget about it.
It's just a clean slate.
If there's anything
I can do for you, you just let me know.
It's funny you should say that, because there actually is.
Tracy and I are doing this event for the children's hospital.
If you wanted to, you could come and spend the day with us
You don't get them sick, they don't get you sick.
Boy.
Yes, I'd love to.
Let me make a couple of phone calls.
No, I can't.
Ho.
I told Fox two months.
What are you eating?
It's a chalupa inside a burrito
It's got the best food in the world and you're eating a chalupa?
If I could've put French toast in this motherfucker,
I would, okay?
Look at this.
Huh?
Do you believe this?
Asshole.
Asshole.
Sync and corrections by n17t01
Fuck.
I'm a woman, aren't I? think you were the type who would want a guy to hold the door open for you.
I thought you might not want that, that's all.
I was just trying not to offend you, and yet I wound up offending you, which is quite ironic.
Yes, it's a mathematical equation.
Type plus distance equals no door hold.
Well, you know, what kind of vibe I'm getting from you is that that's a fucked up equation, you know what I mean?
But you can't argue with the distance, though. that's a big factor.
Fatwa. The Musical, written by Larry David.
You wrote a musical about Salman Rushdie having his life ruined cause he got a fatwa, a death threat, from the Ayatollah Khomeini.
I'm telling you, there's a lot of funny stuff in there.
Who do you think about playing Salman Rushdie and what about the ayatollah?
Salman Rushdie,
I don't know, but, uh, the ayatollah,
I'm actually flirting with the notion of doing it.
It's a stupid idea.
Fatwa. People don't wanna see that.
They want uplifting. what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.
It's a good idea.
And by the way, what the hell are you doing here anyway?
Well, I was in the area
Guess who's getting married. with the, uh, you know, the PTSD?
He doesn't have PTSD.
I would know.
I know things.
You don't know.
You know, it comes on in a year or two.
All right. All right, you guys are fuckin' morons.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I'm over it.
He didn't open the door for me.
It was a whole thing.
And then it was offensive to me, obviously,
I wouldn't want the door open.
That's Betty.
Betty, you're too good, I'll tell ya.
And she's marrying her partner in a few weeks.
She's a lesbian.
I hang out with lesbians.
I could use a haircut.
You could.
You could.
And you know what?
I could do it for you.
And I'll open the door for you.
Hey, it's my
Welcome back.
You had a nice little it wasn't a vacation.
You don't come to work for two days because you were constipated?
Yeah. Luckily it was only two days.
The whole world is out there constipated.
Half the population is constipated.
I got married constipated.
People do things constipated.
You wouldn't want me here.
No, I would want you here.
Why wouldn't I want you here?
I don't function well with the feeling of heaviness.
I feel like I'm wearing a cement inner tube. it's about being available for it to happen.
And it hasn't totally happened,
I'm gonna be honest.
The blessed event hasn't occurred yet?
Aye, lassie. I admire your courage.
This is one of those fields, like many, that isn't researched enough. champion the cause of constipation.
You could go on, you could have fundraisers. you could have groups where people who are constipated and talk about their problems. you might wanna think about?
Instead of sitting in a chair at your desk, put in a toilet seat.
You know, have an office bathroom.
Aw. Hmm.
I'll send him a little text.
How about that?
Yeah, well,
Yes, perhaps if it were a person,
I would agree with you.
Hey, do me a favor.
This pen is out of ink.
I need a refill.
Okay?
There you go.
There you go.
You got the refill.
You have the refill.
You have the refill.
You take that.
Okay.
And think about that toilet.
You just sit there at your desk.
Pretty good idea.
Hey.
Turn this down.
It's too loud. a fuckin' minute.
You're lamping?
Chillin.
Relaxing.
Why did you change it from chillin'?
What was wrong with chillin'?
Got to get another one?
Lamping?
And chillin' is what?
You gotta be in real clothes?
You upright.
You chillin' upright.
I gotta say.
That's a boss shirt.
You can keep that boss shit. boss isn't happening, is it, huh?
Hey, I wouldn't even say that shit by mistake. my assistant, okay, doesn't come to work for two days.
You know why?
You know what she tells me?
Who doesn't come to work cause they're constipated?
Have you ever heard of that?
Come on, I shot a porno constipated.
I ran a 5k marathon constipated.
Shit, man, come on. contest constipated.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
You shot a porno? contest constipated.
And I still fucking won.
That's not a fucking excuse.
You got to fire that bitch.
Yeah, well, that's easier said than done. she's got a limp and a cane.
I can't.
I can't do it.
And by the way, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Okay.
What the fuck else could it be?
I'm not at liberty
I don't wanna say.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You fucking walk all the way the fuck over here, you disturb me from fucking lamping, and you ain't even gonna fucking tell me what the fuck it is?
I can't say.
Tell me what the fuck going on.
Let's just say her uncle fucked her. the dilemma that I have?
She's unfirable.
She used to work for Jimmy Kimmel and he recommended her to me.
He said she was great, and she's awful.
Why would he recommend her?
I know what the fuck happened.
He foisted you, man.
Fucking Jimmy Kimmel foisted that bitch on you.
What do you mean?
Don't you ever allow yourself to get foisted.
You have to get rid of this bitch.
You know what, every now and then, yeah, I gotta say, you surprise me.
Whoo.
Boom. Boom.
Is that still workable?
The fist bump?
There's people still doing that, yeah.
Will you let me know when that goes out of fashion?
When that shit stop,
I'll let you know.
And if you see me doing anything else that the black community might frown upon as being uncool, you're gonna let me know.
I'll stop your ass.
You know I will.
Now go upstairs and start lamping.
I just never thought that
No, my mother used to say to me, you never get excited.
Well, I'm excited,
Here Comes The Bride?
You're getting
Here Comes The Bride?
Yeah.
With all due respect, yeah, I don't see bride.
I don't see bride, okay, from here.
No, try and see it.
Try and see it.
I have a veil with, like,
Look, you got a picture of Numa?
Okay, she's beautiful, obviously.
That's a groom.
Believe me,
I say this only with the best intentions.
That's a fuckin' bride.
You a goddamn groom.
I'll see you later. Mm.
Hey, we need more peanut butter.
Think about what I said.
You're a lovely girl,
Betty, but, uh, you're not a bride.
Unfortunately.
What is this name, PAM?
That's the best you could do?
No, it's People Against Mutilation, genital mutilation.
Yeah, I know what it stands for.
And there are very few charities that actually focus on the clitoris and talk about it.
I think you got half the population focused on the clitoris.
Truth is I think we're better friends now than when we were married.
I think Jeff's looking for you.
Yeah, one second.
Gotta go talk to my manager.
Crazy, crazy exciting.
Every producer
I sent Fatwa. to is in.
Get out there, start talking about this.
This is very exciting.
Hey, how much does
Betty charge you for a haircut?
No, no, no.
Hey, it's Lewis.
Come here.
All right, I'll meet you over there.
Fine. the middle would've been over there.
I took way more steps than you did to get here.
There's a lot of producers interested in it.
The good news is
I'm still alive.
This is a tragedy and you treated it like it was nothing to me.
You don't? Why not?
It's my bird.
I don't live in a Cuban dancehall.
I live in my own home and it doesn't take toucans.
You know, it's a dead parakeet.
That's a funny thing.
I loved him.
It was unconditional love. know you from a hole in the wall.
He knows me. He knew you.
Remember he came over once?
He went, Seinfeld, Seinfeld.
He loved you, too.
I'm not quite sure it was Seinfeld.
Yeah, that's not Seinfeld.
You know why I'm laughing?
At the sadness of your entire existence.
I take that as a great compliment.
Well, there's a lack of empathy and compassion and sympathy for practically everything in your life.
There's a lack of everything.
You're supposed to be able to take a joke, you know?
You're supposed to laugh about everything.
Just because I'm a comedian, I have to find everything in the world funny?
Yes, everything's funny.
You're devoid of anything that's remotely caring or empathetic.
This, to me, is a tragedy.
No, you came from that way.
You go that way,
I'll go this way.
No, I wanna go that way.
I'm late, I'm late.
I know.
Nice of you to show up.
Well, Larry,
I've never been like this in my life.
Did Jeff tell you about my new business?
It's a great name.
You've been working at night on it?
Nonstop. I think I'm gonna have to hire an assistant. maybe more than one.
What?
Did I just hear you say you needed to hire an assistant?
I think I do, yeah.
I'm burning the candles on both ends.
Well, you know, I'm gonna be going to New York to do the play.
Yeah, Fatwa.
And I'm not gonna be able to take my assistant.
I ever had.
Well, what's her history?
You're gonna be on the phone with her here and you're in New York?
That's ridiculous.
That doesn't make any sense.
You need to hire a new assistant in New York and let me take this one.
What the hell?
I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, Lar.
Trust me.
Fantastic.
Pretty good.
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. you can't be the groom.
I'm just saying
I think I might not be the bride.
I saw myself and then I'm gonna
What are you doing here? the door was ajar.
You. You're the one that put this in her head? the door ajar.
You have no business weighing in on this wedding, okay?
It's not completely
Look, you're a beautiful bride.
I don't wanna be the bride.
You're not groomy, she's not bridey. to have an opinion about this?
Well, because I know her.
She gave me a haircut.
She charged a lot of money for it, by the way.
What kind of psychopath interferes with the nuances of a lesbian wedding?
Hey, I saw wrong and tried to right it. That's all. about Robert Kennedy at his funeral.
Robert Kennedy.
Well, don't leave the door ajar.
What is really going on here?
Do you need a hobby?
Not a terrible idea. about that. a good idea.
I just can't seem to find the motivation.
You know, when I was a kid,
I would collect butterflies.
I would go in the park,
I would use the net.
I didn't expect you
I didn't expect an actual answer to that question.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter about him.
It doesn't matter about him.
I just want you to be happy.
I want us to have a successful wedding and a successful life.
You waited too long.
That's everything
I need to know. the door for me, you prick.
You see?
See what happens?
I held the door, she didn't like it.
You chastised me for holding the door.
What's a guy supposed to do?
I'm betwixt and between.
Cause I asked Jeff what you charged him for a haircut and he told me $75.
Get the fuck out of my house.
Okay.
Okay, I got it.
I got that.
Okay, 'cause of the musical,
I might be going to New York.
And I thought,
I got you a job with my friend, a very close friend of mine, as her assistant.
This woman really knows what she's doing.
And by the way, she's such a terrific person. she's a fucking saint, okay?
Don't take this the wrong way.
Always, this job felt a little bit a good opportunity.
We can start right now.
Anyway, let's go.
There we go.
Okay, take the plant.
Yeah.
There you go.
Okay.
Take your water.
Get this out.
There we go.
They speed along.
Nah.
I don't think so.
All right, then.
I'll tell you what.
Let's do one of these.
There we go.
Now you got your box, we had a little hug.
That was a foist.
She ain't gonna limp her ass back up in here, right?
No chance.
I can do this.
What?
What are you talkin' about?
I can do this shit.
What?
Do what shit?
Come on, man.
Larry David's office.
You only get half price cause you drive a goddamn Smart car.
All right?
Don't call me no fucking more.
Mm.
What's happening?
Good to see you.
Hey, Jeff.
What's up?
I'm gonna take it outside.
Fucking good as fuck.
All right?
What are you doing?
Don't take that.
Lamping?
There's no G at the end.
Lampin.
Lampin. Okay. let me congratulate you, by the way.
On the wonderful, fantastic job of foisting that you did.
You foisted Mara on me.
I did foist her on you. and by the way, Marty Short foisted her on me.
He foisted her on you.
Okay, well, guess what.
Well, thanks for coming.
It's great to have you here.
Yes, yes.
I've written a musical for Broadway.
A fatwa is a death sentence handed out by the ayatollah.
And this is a comedy?
It's a musical comedy.
Of course the ayatollah is in it.
How can you have a fatwa without an ayatollah?
You do need an ayatollah, right.
What appeals to you about the ayatollah? the denunciation.
There's a lot of denunciation going on.
I started to get denunciation elbows.
It requires a lot of energy.
Yeah, yeah.
How many ayatollahs are there?
Are there only one ayatollah?
Well, now there's only one ayatollah, and they all seem to have the same name and they all seem to spell it the same way. if you look at the history of ayatollahs, like one person. and their names are
Khamenei, Khameeni, Khomani.
In a way, it's like the way KFC he doesn't like Waze. he likes to navigate on his own, you know?
He gets in the car.
He doesn't like to be told things.
Do you know about the ayatollah's life? does he eat cereal?
He loves granola.
Well, well.
Look at you.
You got here ahead of me.
I can't believe it.
God damn right.
I'm doing my fucking dizzle, baby. you're workin.
Hey, that ayatollah bit you did on Kimmel was fucking great.
Larry David's office.
What's up?
Okay, transfer it to here.
How?
Hold on, Jeff.
Hold on.
Every goddamn channel.
You're a complete
You're a total,
Larry David, who you may know as the cocreator of Seinfeld, went on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night to talk about his new musical called Fatwa. in which the ayatollah is one of the main characters.
And twice a year, he goes to Ireland on a harem shopping spree.
Today, the Ayatollah
Abdullah Kazemaini of Iran has accused Larry David of blasphemy, issuing an actual fatwa and calling for the death of the comedian.
No one would dare insult the sacred beliefs of Muslims, nor disparage our honor.
I didn't disparage.
There was no disparage.
I begged you not to imitate the ayatollah.
I said you got to get this message to him.
Jeff told you to tell me not to do the ayatollah?
No. I'll repent.
I'll be punished.
Even if Larry David repents, he will be condemned to death.
I'll become a Muslim.
Even if Larry David converts to Islam, he should still be sent to hell.
No. takes this very seriously.
The fucking guy was on television, screaming my name.
Larry David.
Larry David.
Larry David.
What kind of fucking question is that?
Okay.
I wanna know what my situation is.
What do you know about it?
I go on the Jimmy Kimmel show and I apologize.
I've already talked to the Kimmel show.
They want nothing to do with you.
This whole thing's falling apart.
Every Fatwa. producer has called me.
This is all dead.
Hey.
Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt.
What am I supposed to do?
Disguises have been employed effectively in the past.
Needless to say, it wasn't very pleasant.
Have you ever seen
Undercover Boss?
The guy goes undercover, nobody even knows who he is.
He's the boss of the whole company.
He fools everybody.
Well, you know what the good news is?
I'm still alive.
You know what?
That's not funny.
You should be able to take a joke.
What, you're comparing this to your dead parakeet?
Larry David.
Larry David?
Where the fuck are you, Larry?
Prepare to die, baldy.
I know you're in here, Larry.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
And the next time a door's ajar, maybe stay the fuck out.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Larry fucking David.
Fatwa?
No, cocksucker.
Foisted.

What's going on, man?
It's fucking crazy in this fucking room.
You need sunlight, man.
You turning white.
What?
I'm in a hotel.
You think you're safe in a hotel?
I think I'm safer here than in my house.
The bottom line you can't fucking hide here.
These motherfuckers want you, they're gonna come and get you.
Cut your fucking hands off, cut your feet off, put your feet in your back pockets, put your hands in your front pockets, and then carry your ass out of here like a piece of fucking luggage.
How are you helping?
I'm just letting him know what happens.
You don't need this shit.
You go to your house.
No one's coming.
I talked to the FBI guy.
He's not gonna lie.
No one is coming.
But I can't go back to the house.
No, no, no, no.
You can't fucking sell the house.
All of my ladies know
I live there already.
You're gonna set me back two or three years.
No, you fucking stay there.
You fucking stay.
Get back to your life.
Get back on the horse now.
Ah.
I was there first.
I should've got that.
It's no big deal.
I got it.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, look at you.
Look at me.
May I ask you a question?
Why double down on the seediness?
I think I look really good.
Mm, I mean, look at dentists.
They don't walk around with their smocks on when they're not in their office.
I know, but you don't have to show everybody.
Imagine putting on a beautiful dress from
Saks Fifth Avenue, you know?
You're not able to afford it now, but get one dress and I guarantee you in six months, your closet will be packed with dresses like that.
Really?
Good luck.
Good luck.
You can do it.
I'm checking out a lot earlier than I had anticipated. 1003. And what is the name on 1003?
Okay, well, be sure to visit our website.
We love notes.
It's suffocating.
Don't tuck.
I will take that note on advisement.
We have a wonderful pastry chef.
Ah, I see you went for the big ones,
Tongs? Yes, yes,
I saw the tongs there.
I eschewed the tongs deliberately because the tongs are not made for picking up cookies. the cookie.
Here, look,
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Perfect. Great.
Seem to be making a moment of it,
It's just it's hard to hold it.
Let me ask you who put you in charge of the cookies?
Do you oversee the cookies?
They're wonderful.
I got news for you, pal.
This is a Pepperidge Farm cookie.
This is a Pepperidge Farm cookie, that's it.
Well, I will go to that pastry chef and I will confront him about it.
Don't tell people these are by a pastry chef.
I don't believe those are
Pepperidge Farm cookies.
This is a Pepperidge Farm cookie.
All right,
Mr Dancer, well,
I will take that
I'm a little disappointed.
I could buy this in the grocery store on my way home, so. putting out Pepperidge Farm.
Linda, can we get these cookies out of the way that he touched?
I don't want you to use these doors anymore. You got that?
You should worry about that goddamn fireplace.
You're gonna fuck around and forget and Fatwa Claus gonna come down that fucking chimney and kill your ass.
What is this shit?
What are you eating?
You know how bad that is for you?
Have you ever read the ingredients?
Have you ever tried one of these motherfuckers?
Look, beef, of course, molasses, wheat, brown sugar.
Brown fucking sugar.
I love fucking brown sugar.
You think black people prefer brown sugar over white sugar?
Anything brown over fucking white.
Fuck. Okay, get the door.
Ask who it is.
Don't forget.
I'll answer the door.
LD, come down here.
Member of six clubs runs them all.
He was just voted high school
I don't wanna be a hater, but can't nobody do all that shit in one day.
Well, I mean,
That motherfucker lived a life. running across the country.
What kind of a question is that?
We got a lot of meats, man.
All kind of shits in that fridge.
You like bologna and shit?
Let's get off that.
Looks like he can't lift a chess piece.
Yeah, you'd have a good time hitting him.
Here, try that mustard.
It's dope.
Larry has all kind of goodies in here.
All kind of cheeses and meats.
Do you need any help?
I got it, I got it.
Everybody's gotta be the hero with a pickle jar.
Everybody wants to open it.
You just gotta hit it up.
We gotta go to the hospital.
Valedictorian, now you wanna be pickle boy.
You know, I think we have a half open jar in the fridge.
What do you know?
Well, that's what they want me to do.
Yeah.
I had a horrible night last night.
Horrible.
It, like, freaked me out.
Well, you know what?
There was a lot of shit going on last night.
I had a little lady friend come over.
You know?
I didn't keep you up.
You don't need no Pinkerton guard.
You know what?
I'll tell you what. of that Pinkerton motherfucker?
I wanna take care of all this security shit you're worried about, okay? get you back to being Larry.
Well, no, the only reason
I'm wearing this bathrobe is because I left you know, those red flannel pajamas?
Never fails.
If they show the fuck up, they show the fuck up.
Goodbye, darling.
I'm all right.
I'm a mess.
Yeah, and the worst part is the musical's off.
It was such a funny idea.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
All right,
I'm full of shit.
The truth is
I'm here to ask your permission if I can date Cheryl.
Boom.
Yeah, you come over here under these false pretenses to see how I'm doing,
If you're asking me can you date Cheryl, I'd say no. step back just a second.
This is a surprise to me, too.
We're friends. I didn't wanna sneak around behind your back. to go with my impulses, and my impulse is
How would you like it if I went out with Mary, huh?
You know what?
I'll call her right now. How's that?
How's that?
I'll call Mary.
You want me to?
But then can we get back to this real subject?
You know what's going on with Ted and Cheryl?
Ted told me he was interested in seeing her and I told him to go for it.
I don't know if we have anything in common that way, you know?
We're Earthlings, we breathe, we eat, we have that in common.
Yeah, we have that in common with pretty much everybody, like, you know, maybe you're just not my physical type.
Sure.
Sure, I understand.
Okay?
Sex only in the dark.
She's a little revolted by the penis.
Yeah, thanks.
I know.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, hides the Jew.
Ah, thank you.
Thank you.
That's lovely.
Lovely compliment.
Thank you very much. very difficult for me.
And I'm thinking, who can help me?
I don't know any Muslims.
They're not in show business.
They don't hang out at the deli.
Am I supposed to go into a mosque and then start chatting them up?
Sure, maybe I can make a little more effort to seek them out, but they're not really coming up to me either.
Do you need my help, Larry?
Yes.
Yes.
I always thought it was muffti.
I know the consul of Iran.
You know the consul?
Look at you.
I have my connections. are you a plotter?
Are you one of the plotters?
Wow.
You're on my side, right?
Fuck me, you godless fuck.
You infidel fucking Jew.
Try and keep it kosher, could you?
You fatwa fucking bastard.
Blaspheme to me like you blasphemed to the Nation of Islam.
Donald Trump.
Steve Bannon.
Jared Kushner.
Mike Pence.
Kellyanne Conway.
Rudy Giuliani.
Yeah, yeah.
Rougher, Larry.
Rougher.
Sentence me to an orgasm
Is this a fatwa.
This is a fatwa.
Fatwa. Fatwa.
Hey. Hey.
No fatwa up in here.
No fatwa.
Yeah, Larry, that's Swat, your knew security.
You can thank me later for that shit.
Yeah, I'm not even gonna bring up the fact you're fucking in your goddamn glasses.
Hey, Swat, break her ass in half. is this Mr Khashayar?
I'm a friend of Shara Ghorbani.
She said that perhaps there might be a way, you know, to set up
Could you hold on one second?
Shut the fuck up.
I'm on the phone.
Hey, I'm gonna give Swat the guest room.
Where the towels at?
They're down the hall in the linen closet.
Yeah, the video call would work great.
Good. I will have one of my staff members contact you to arrange for it.
Hold on one more sec.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Shh, I'm on the phone.
This goddamn towel's hard as fuck, man.
Shut the fuck up.
I'm on the phone.
I'll be there in a second.
Shut up.
These towels too rough, man.
Shut up.
No, it's the nincompoops again.
Look, these towels are a little too rough, man.
Velvet, it doesn't even dry you, velvet. it doesn't get the water off.
A harder, coarser towel works a lot better for drying.
I'ma get ashy as hell, Lar.
The man's a guest in your house.
He's your fucking security. you need to familiarize yourself with that.
No stone fruit?
I'm telling you, they kill me, Larry.
I'll drop dead right on this fucking carpet.
Even the oals will fuck me up.
Yeah.
All right, thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Well, they're not baked, they're bought in a store.
But that's neither here nor there.
Let me just ask you about the display here. the display, the tongs, the whole thing? the tong is not a friend of the cookie by any stretch of the imagination.
Okay, you must be
Mr Dancer.
No friend of the cookie.
May I just demonstrate what I'm talking about?
I successfully was able to find your pajama bottoms, and I see that you are not using our tongs again.
The tongs dropped on the floor, you put them back on the table?
That's like eating off the floor.
It is the same thing. You might as well put the floor on the table.
Okay, you know what is a disgrace, that we're having this conversation again.
And here is what I'm gonna
Like I would wanna return to a hotel that's serving Pepperidge Farm cookies and trying to pass them off as if you have a pastry chef.
Fine, and if you do,
I will call the police, Mr Buck Dancer.
Kenny was a perfect kid, and look what's happened here.
Look what's happened to my jewel, my nephew, who is
He's up there now in a cast.
Why did you have to fight him for the pickle?
Why did I have to fight him?
You fought him for the pickles, too.
You tried to open that pickle jar just like I did.
Everybody wants to be a pickle jar hero.
You broke his elbow, okay?
Are you happy?
He's just a different kid.
He's filled with angst.
He's, like, ready to explode.
And you wanna know why?
The way he relaxes is the way all men relax.
It's called ejaculation.
He can't use the right hand, okay?
This is his ejaculator, okay?
It's done, it's in a cast.
What the hell is this shit? Fuck.
You call this lunch? Take your banana and shove it up your ass.
Leave me the fuck alone.
I don't even know him anymore.
He can't masturbate.
He can't make it come out.
It's funny, though, there's other things I can do lefty.
I can eat lefty,
I can brush my teeth lefty.
There's a big difference.
You need rotation, you need tempo, you need feel.
I don't know what's gonna happen cause he can't concentrate anymore.
He told me today he doesn't give a shit about the SATs.
He doesn't care about Stanford.
He doesn't care about anything.
Hey.
I met this woman she could help him.
What does she do? she's a prostitute.
Okay, here's the deal.
You're gonna go in there, you're gonna go to the right,
This is called the pickle gambit.
I like that, man.
Hey, it's cool.
He played first base for the 1919 White Sox, the team that threw the World Series.
Wait a fucking minute.
I'm not gonna be on no goddamn White Sox.
Yeah, give me a fucking name.
That's fucking great.
I love it.
I'm a diversion.
I got you.
I fucking got you, Lar, all right?
I'm gonna have to put you on hold for a second.
Give it here, Chappie.
Give me a shot at it.
Guys, I saw from over there.
Let me just get a run at it, all right?
I'm small, but you'd be surprised.
Let me see that, let me see that.
Just try it again.
Put force into it.
I didn't get a good run at it.
Come on.
It worked.
My life has been changed. never been better. gentle, respectful.
I did a hooker mitzvah.
It's a hooker mitzvah.
You are a visionary.
I don't know what I can do to properly show my thanks.
You don't have to do anything.
The mere fact that you're happier having sex with a multitude of strangers, the thanks I need.
Aw, Larry.
Thank you.
You know what?
I came here specifically looking for you. my friend's nephew.
Tell me when and where.
I'll be there. let's raid the minibar like normal people.
Yes.
Here, give it to me, give it to me.
You can't open it.
We need to get a butter knife.
We need a plier, we need a plier.
But a hatchet will shatter the entire jar.
Mr Dancer.
Whoa.
Claudia, get security.
I'll keep
Mr Buck Dancer here.
I don't care, I don't care.
I'm not touching cookies,
I'm not talking tongs.
I don't care. I warned you if you came back here, this would happen.
I have dementia.
I'll take care of everything.
I like your dress.
Aw, thanks.
I got it at Saks Fifth Avenue.
Take your clothes off,
Kenny.
You know, Mary, she's with this guy, he looks just like me.
She said
I wasn't her type.
Unbelievable.
Ted's going out with Cheryl. married to her in a long time.
There's nothing wrong with that.
You wanna go out with Cheryl, you do it behind my back.
Yeah.
I called Cheryl.
Just to talk to her and see how she was doing, and shopping tips and stuff like that.
A walk in the park.
Yeah, well, it's not a big deal.
One dinner.
I went behind your back.
It's the only way to go.
Yeah, that's true.
I'll see you later.
I'm not staying here by myself.
Mr David, at last we meet
Hey, look at this.
Modern technology, sir.
Let's just say if you wanted to come to Iran one day and visit, you would be going through myself.
I'm not setting foot in that place, with all due respect.
Not gonna set foot there.
Excuse me.
What are you using, tongs?
Yes.
We use tongs.
All right, Mr Consul, go crazy here.
You invented the tong.
I don't think so.
I don't see Iran as the tong inventor.
Mr David, I have a very busy agenda today.
Please let me know how I can help you.
Mr David, you have come to the right person
I am a huge fan of your work.
Is that so?
Isn't everybody's favorite episode the puffy shirt?
It's unbelievable.
It doesn't look like he's popping Life Savers in his mouth all day long, you know?
Come on.
Come on, honey.
You can do it, you can do it.
Come on, come on.
Larry.
No, no. Swat, Swat.
Not her, not her.
Just get rid of the Muslims.
No, it's a game.
That's a game.
Mr Consul.
Sync and corrections by n17t01
Where's our food?
I confirmed it, by the way.
Cheryl and Ted are a thing.
They went to Hawaii together.
Yeah, well, how do you think I feel?
I never should've done that show.
That Kimmel show.
God damn it.
Hi, I'm the manager.
There's been a delay in your meals.
There's been a disturbance in the kitchen.
But we're taking care of it.
Thanks.
Well, what kind of disturbance?
A general disturbance.
What's a general disturbance?
Well, let's just say it was a minor hiccup.
Well, was it a hiccup or a disturbance?
It's such a small disturbance, it might be either one.
What happened?
Let's just say the disturbance happened.
Okay, that's a fact, and we're taking care of it, okay?
Are you listening to this?
I'm glad you thought it was a good question because it was a really atrocious answer.
How in God's name did you get this job?
I am great at dealing with these disturbances.
Yes, really?
I'm asking that because you come off as quite a goofball.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
It's not.
Delicious meal, by the way.
Is there any question that you will answer?
Because you haven't answered one question yet.
What the hell was that?
Why wouldn't he tell me what it was?
There was a small disturbance in the kitchen, but if you go have a seat, we'll get your food right out to you.
Yeah, I know, thanks.
That's okay.
I mean, everything's fine.
I was just wondering, you know, what the disturbance was.
Regular kitchen disturbance.
They happen all the time.
Nothing to worry about.
It was a minor disturbance that we have since taken care of.
If it was, then my food would not have been delayed by 15 minutes.
It wasn't minor, it was major.
What is this, an investigation?
This is a kitchen, sir.
That's all I wanna do.
And then I wanna go home.
You come back, you hear a big crash, you open the door, and your kids are sprawled out, unconscious on the floor.
You say to your wife,
What happened?
And you go, What was the disturbance?
She goes, No, I don't wanna tell you. How would you feel?
I would want to know what the disturbance was.
That's exactly right.
That's a very specific situation, sir.
You'd want to know what the disturbance was, just like me.
There's no children here.
You're acting like a child.
You're the child who's keeping a little secret.
No, you're the little baby who won't tell Daddy what happened.
All right, fine.
I'm coming. Bye.
Yeah, Susie's little sister didn't come home last night. big sister, little sister mentoring program. and she didn't come home last night.
That whole disturbance thing threw us for a loop.
Well, yeah,
I'm taking care of it.
We're too disturbed to eat right now.
Wow, look at this thing.
New Tesla.
Holy cow.
She didn't come home. I don't know where the hell she is.
I've called everybody.
What can I do?
Come here,
I wanna show you the tapes.
Hi, Ted Danson.
Yeah, it's me, asshole.
Okay?
It's my fatwa disguise.
He was at the hotel.
I was in the hotel.
That's where I was hiding.
Why didn't you say hi?
I was going to, but I had to talk to the hotel manager about the pickle jar.
Yeah, everybody wants to open a pickle jar.
Could you get me some sparkling water, please?
You never gave me any little nicknames.
Could've called me L.
You didn't call me L.
You didn't call me D.
You could've called me Elvid.
Like, Let's spoon, Elvid?
You know what? Enough with this bullshit, all right?
Enough with the nicknames.
Nobody gives a shit.
We're looking for my little sister. We have to find her.
She's 15.
How do you know she's gone?
She's probably at her boyfriend's house.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
This kid, Larry, oh.
You think Sammi was talented at her age?
Look at this tape.
Look at that dancing.
Got attitude.
It's wonderful.
Okay, I've seen plenty.
Thank you, I got it.
I get it. I got it.
What do you get?
You don't get shit.
What, do you want me to watch the whole dance recital?
Yes, I do, all right?
We're gonna form a search party and find her.
A search party?
What are we, in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, in 1870?
Find her. Let's go.
Let's go. Split up.
I thought you were okay with this.
Yeah.
Can I look for the kid in your Tesla?
I'd like to drive it.
Come on.
No, I was doing important police business.
Well, with all due respect, a green light is not the time to be doing police business.
This is my friend's car and I'm not really attuned to the subtleties of the horn yet.
It was merely just a reminder beep, a subtle way of telling you,
Time to go.
Let's get moving. Move it on.
License and registration, please.
Are you above the beep?
I protect your rights.
My rights to beep.
Beeping, that's a right.
That's America.
We're allowed to beep.
Yeah? Well, I'm allowed to write this ticket.
Good. Write it.
You getting smart with me, boy?
I'm not getting smart.
I am smart, by the way.
And of course I'll be protesting this ticket.
I hope you enjoy your day in court.
Here you go. Have a nice day.
You made my day.
No one's above the beep.
No one.
No.
Not even a text.
You know why? They're afraid to be on the text chain.
That's fucked up.
They are really showing their true colors.
They don't have no colors.
They're white.
There's no fucking color.
I should just have over black friends.
I'll take Swat over there.
I seen Swat kick a motherfucker one night and broke his fucking back like this.
What did the guy do?
The one thing you don't wanna do around Swat is to speak under your breath.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Have you seen my sunglasses?
I know what you're talking about, but, no, I haven't seen them.
I've been looking all over for them. I love those glasses.
Swat, God damn.
What the fuck's going on in there, man?
I'm cooking, man.
Nothing going on. Just cooking.
You're causing a fucking disturbance.
Yeah, yeah, you're making a disturbance.
This ain't no disturbance.
I'm cooking chicken spaghetti.
No, it's not up to you to say whether it's a disturbance or not.
We're the ones being disturbed.
It's our call.
We're playing War.
We're playing cards.
I just fucking told you, don't talk under your breath.
You wanna get fucked up?
Okay, well, this is the coup de grâce.
I just can't.
There's only one man who could help me.
We've been expecting you.
Please come in.
Okay.
And if you'd follow me.
This way.
Please have a seat.
Thank you. Thank you for seeing me, Mr Rushdie.
Salman? There's an accent on the second syllable.
Yeah, I heard about your problem.
And I thought if there's anybody who could understand what
I'm going through, it's you.
And to tell you the truth,
I'm at my wit's end.
It took me a long time.
It took me maybe several years to get to the point that I'm going to talk to you about now.
I want to give you a shortcut, which is that, yeah, it is all those things.
It can be scary, it can be bewildering, et cetera.
But there are things that you gain.
There are a lot of women who are attracted to you in this condition.
Really? I didn't think there was any condition
There are very beautiful women who like that.
Even with me they would like it? it's the fatwa wrapped around you.
Like kind of sexy pixie dust.
Huh.
But you have to stop acting like a wuss.
Be a man, stop this, and fatwa sex will follow.
What about the fatwa itself?
You know, you've survived many, many years now.
It's a tough one.
I've tried it with orthotics.
It didn't really work very well.
There. Now, look, there you are.
You're a man of danger.
Let's go out, get a bite to eat.
Trust me.
Let's eat.
That's my boy.
Hello. Table for two, please.
Of course, Mr Rushdie.
Hello, Mr David.
And your server will be right with you guys.
You can go in a supermarket, go to a ball game.
I'm feeling a lot better about things.
This musical, it's about me, right?
You mean, like,
No, you know, that was just a character that he played.
I mean, he's short.
He's a lot shorter than me.
What?
Hmm. Well, who are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about, you know, Hugh Jackman.
He can sing, he can dance, he can act.
I think you're delusional.
Anyway, it's all moot.
What's the difference, you know?
It's not gonna happen.
All right, well, that's a relief.
It's too bad, too, because what you said about fatwa sex?
I would've put that right in the show.
Can you come pick me up at the airport?
You say, Can't make it.
Fatwa. Can't make it.
This is a fatwa
Life of Riley.
You know what's happening?
Pretty, pretty good.
She sent you a drink.
This is what
I'm talking about.
Here it is, right here.
What are you talking to me for?
Go talk to her.
Do this. Go for it.
I just can't believe you're out and about.
Look, I'm not gonna walk around with a mustache and a wig.
Hello, ladies, I'm the manager.
I really apologize about your lunch being late.
There was a disturbance in the kitchen.
Yes, we have a very big kitchen, and we're moving forward now, and we're going to get your meal right away.
Can't wait.
He hasn't told you one thing about the disturbance, has he?
You didn't tick a box.
The boxes are empty.
I beg to differ.
Let's get on to that delicious lunch.
All right, thank you.
I wanna know everything there is to know about Larry David.
He completely changed my outlook on this whole thing.
At the end of the conversation, he got up, he ripped off my wig, and said, Come on, we're going out to lunch.
She's better every day.
Pretty good. Anyway, Elizabeth
We had a lovely conversation, and I saw her last night.
What the hell are you doing here, anyway?
I think I might've left my sunglasses here.
You know, the Dr. Strangelove glasses?
Yeah, would you mind looking for them?
Yeah, I would mind looking for them.
I'm busy looking for a little girl.
You could do both.
It's like Jeff's Cubs hat.
Have you found your Cubs hat?
No, I have not.
I'm sure if you ran across
Jeff's Cubs hat, you would call it to his attention.
Same thing with the sunglasses.
Dr. Strangelove glasses.
I care about this kid, my little sister.
Just keep it in the back of your mind.
Look, I've got Katie in the back of my mind.
I've got the sunglasses up front,
Katie's in the back.
Katie should be in the front for both of you.
She's not an inanimate object.
Okay, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you.
I'm gonna move Katie all the way up to the front.
I'm gonna give her equal footing with the sunglasses.
Both in front of my mind.
Where's my Cubs hat in this scenario?
I can't handle three in the front.
It's too much. It's overload.
I'll move Katie back two paces.
I'm gonna move your
Cubs hat to the front.
That works perfect.
Maybe that's her.
She's still gone. that car of yours got me a ticket.
How?
I was at a stoplight and I beeped a cop.
What's that have to do with my car?
Because your horn cannot hit the subtle notes required in the art of beeping.
I'm telling you, that horn is gonna get you in a lot of trouble.
Wow. Are you gonna pay it?
No. I'm fighting it.
I mean, Your Honor,
I don't even know why I'm here.
There should be no such thing as a ticket for this.
It's our inalienable right to beep.
Without the freedom to beep, we are no better than the beasts in the field.
And I'm not talking about the common chicken.
That's enough of that talk about donkeys and field chickens.
That's enough.
Never, Your Honor.
I'm a first to beep a cop.
I'm a pioneer, Your Honor.
In the mold of a Rosa Parks. you're in the mold of?
Maybe a Martin Luther King or a Malcolm X?
Harriet Tubman?
Yes, Harriet Tubman.
Although I'm not quite sure what she did,
I have a feeling she was in the pioneer family.
I was talking to you outside.
You never mentioned anything.
Wouldn't have killed you.
I think we need to get back to you beeping right now.
Your Honor, may I offer you a cough drop?
You know, you're a judge, you're talking a lot, there are people here all the time.
Take it.
Yeah.
The chances of me putting that in my mouth are very slim.
Well, if you're not gonna suck on it, you might as well return it.
That may be the first thing that we've agreed on today.
Now take your unsucked candy and get back to your desk.
Okay, let the record show I had a good time in the well.
Love the well.
Your Honor, are you listening to what this man is saying over here?
You weren't paying attention,
You most certainly cannot
I'm affirming the citation.
Very well.
I will pay your citation.
But I cannot leave this courtroom without telling you that a grave injustice has been done here,
I did it for you and you and you.
For we are not donkeys.
That was just a reminder beep.
That was just a reminder beep.
Reminder beep?
Reminder for what?
No, no, that was an aggressive fucking beep.
It's a new car and I'm not used to the subtleties of the beeps.
No, I don't give a shit.
Come here. Get out here.
Wait, wait, wait.
It's me, Ted Danson.
Becker, Cheers, anything? Jesus.
Hi, Jeff.
This is Elizabeth Banks.
I get it.
Why don't you come inside, all right?
Okay, okay.
We'll go inside.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
You know, we were just in the neighborhood having a little drive.
I heard about your little sister.
With all due respect, losing a cat is nothing like losing a child.
Well, with all due respect,
I mean, that cat was my child.
I would say I know her quite well.
She's an underprivileged child we took into our home, and she feels like our own little girl.
Mr Noodle slept on your bosom?
Yeah.
I'm happy to tweet a recent photo of her.
I do have a lot of followers.
I have a video of her dancing.
I saw the tape of the dancing.
I don't wanna get into it.
What was the last dance program you ever saw?
Did you go to
Martha Graham? No.
Yeah, because I don't like to go out of my way to be bored.
I could show Elizabeth right now a video of her dancing, which is magnificent.
I'll watch that video and you can watch a video of Mr Noodle chasing a string.
Look, I just wanna be helpful, you know?
Why the fuck do you call him Elvid?
A cop car just pulled up, Jeff.
My glasses.
Where'd you find her,
Officer?
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Come on.
That's Jeff's Cubs hat.
You gotta call the fire department.
The fire department?
That's very dangerous,
Elvid.
I got this, Lizzie.
Wow, Elvid.
Oh.
It's a fantastic idea.
Say I invite you over for dinner one night.
Okay, I like where this is going.
Sure.
We don't wanna deal with that, right?
Wait till tomorrow.
We've got other things to do.
No, we don't even need to wait till tomorrow.
I open up the app, five minutes later, there's people doing the dishes.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a suspect.
He vandalized police property.
Larry David.
Hi, I'm the restaurant manager.
How may I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Larry David.
He's one of our more engaging customers.
I just don't understand how you and
You're not answering any of my questions.
Well, I just wanna tell you,
I'm here to support the men in blue 110 percents.
We gotta come up with a plan.
One of the Girl
Scouts is Asian.
It's good to be specific when you lie.
It's the cornerstone of a good lie.
And the lemonade was delicious.
Yes, and all of a sudden, a gust of Santa Ana wind comes along and knocks the rake off the roof onto the hood of the car.
I got it. Yes, of course.
Are you kidding?
I did Shakespeare.
I can handle this.
You vandalized my car.
They were the little ones, the Brownies, one of whom was Indian.
And we decided that we actually wanted Arnold Parkers,
Arnold Palmer.
Well, let's leave that detail for another day.
An Irishman who went into the house.
All right, you're coming with me.
It landed on your vehicle.
Great. Great performance.
That's the worst performance
I've ever seen in my life.
I do better with a little more preparation.
You should arrest her for bad acting.
Look, I need a rehearsal.
Hello?
What the fuck?
Well, there's been a disturbance in the kitchen.Salman Rushdie told me to live my life.
I'm having this dream.
Right, the head count.
Are you expecting more or less?
I'm expecting 72.
What if you just miscounted?
Larry, you seem preoccupied.
This is not a comfortable chair at all.
What was going through your head when you picked out this chair?
You picked out a great chair for yourself.
That's a gorgeous chair.
I would have that in my house.
But this one, it's not comfortable.
I'm constantly shifting from side to side.
You have the comfortable chair.
You have taken the good chair.
I don't find that interesting at all.
I don't know what you're writing over there.
Chair issues.
May I be honest with you?
I hope that you can always be honest with me.
Well, I'm often never honest with you, but here's what I'm proposing.
I think you should go chair shopping.
I think you need another chair.
And you know what else? I'm willing to go chair shopping with you.
Will you think about it?
It's tough for you to have to look at that watch, isn't it?
It must be a little awkward.
You know I see it.
I know you see it.
I'm not trying to sneak it.
I'm not trying to do a sneaky watch peek,
I'm trying to be efficient with our time.
This weekend and all through next week my wife and I go out every single night to a different restaurant because it's truffle season.
Okay. Thank you, Larry.
Okay. And, by the way, any time you wanna get rid of me as a patient, just say, I've had enough.
Hey. How about this?
I don't even know how to react.
Yeah, yeah,
I saw her earlier. real estate agent.
You looking for a house?
Well, I'm gonna go out looking for houses, but I'm not looking for a house.
Wow.
What a diabolical plan this is.
It's a date, but they don't know it's a date.
I just go, You know what?
This house doesn't appeal to me.
Tomorrow, are you good to see another house?
She's excited to be with me.
She wants to please me.
They love me.
They're loving it. but, still, I can congratulate you.
Are you vying for the title of the most pretentious man in the world?
I've had this for decades.
It looks like the Little
No, it's very confusing.
I'm very excited.
Then maybe you could explain the mystery of that one.
I will.
This is one of my favorites.
That's you?
What do you think a self portrait means? Yeah, that's me.
That's like you from 50 years ago.
You honestly feel you look like that? 100 percents.
You know what?
I think I want a portrait by Richard Lewis.
Yeah, well, look, he's gonna make you look great.
Maybe you could paint me with hair.
Did you hear about Marty
Funkhouser's nephew, Kenny?
I know.
He was supposed to be going to Stanford.
Yeah.
Ended up going to Pamplona to run with the bulls.
How does a young boy get involved with a prostitute?
Where's the two and two?
Again, very detailed.
No, I'm just putting two and two together, that's all.
You're running with the bulls.
It'd be shocking if he didn't die.
It's what men do.
He wanted to impress the prostitute?
Yeah, usually, you don't have to impress a prostitute.
I was just trying to impress you.
Yeah, but she's not a prostitute.
It's the worst thing that's happened to me in my life.
Although, my daughter is transitioning.
You know, I saw her a couple of weeks ago. She looked pretty good.
He's talking about it.
It takes time to decide.
Well, if he gets the penis, do they throw in the balls?
Is there anything we can do?
Hey, Cheryl, um, let me ask you a question.
When you're at
I've never thought about the chair when I was in therapy.
I think it's great.
Do you like him?
I'm only seeing him because of the whole fatwa business, that's all.
Believe me.
I recommended him to you.
I'm not talking about you.
All I'm saying is next time you're there, just be kind of aware of the chairs and the striking difference between the two, and tell me that
Good choice.
It's truffle season.
What?
How do you know it's truffle season?
Dr. Templeton told me.
What do you talk about in your sessions?
Ay, dah.
There's not enough room to get my hand in there to get the penis out.
I've never really come across this problem before.
Can't get my penis out of my pants?
Have you ever heard of a short fly?
And I'm not gonna unbutton and have them drop on the floor.
Yeah, like tiddlywinks.
You're goddamn right.
Why would they make a little fly
See, I'ma tell you,
I don't have that problem cause I buy my shit from Jamaica.
My pants are slacks.
That's just such nonsense.
What are you saying that for?
Hey.
Front door was unlocked.
You left the door unlocked again?
We never had that conversation, ever.
I gotta talk to you quickly.
What's wrong with him?
I've never had lunch with him in 20 years where I haven't been looking at a wall.
I say trick him the next time in terms of what time lunch is.
Once I start laughing,
I'm a part of this shit.
Get the fuck out.
You heard him.
Let you handle your business.
I'm trying to be casual, but it's really difficult.
And you know they have cookies at the open houses.
Yeah.
Fuck, yeah, I was.
He's listening to the whole thing?
Yes.
You said leave, you didn't say I couldn't come back.
I can't really tell, and there's a lot of people, it's very crowded, and I'm feeling a lot of anxiety.
And then all of a sudden,
This is it and I can't get out,
I'm trapped.
Can I stop you right there for a second?
Can I tell you what is really on my mind?
How did Cheryl know that my wife and
I love truffles?
You told Cheryl.
There's been a breach of the
There's no such thing as
I think what you're referring to confidentiality, and that's a whole different ball game.
Larry, what I try to create here is a circle of trust.
I'd rather not.
All right. Well, then I'll do it with my own arms. nothing should leave this circle.
It should be ironclad.
All right,
Larry, I think this is a breakthrough.
No, it's not a breakthrough.
I think it's a breakthrough.
It's not a breakthrough.
I'm pretty sure it's a breakthrough.
I'm gonna write down breakthrough.
You writing down breakthrough is just a waste of everybody's time.
Anything else on your mind?
You know, I've got these pants, okay, and they have a short fly.
Very hard to, uh, extricate the penis.
You ever had a pair of pants like that where you can't get your penis out?
I think you unzip, you dive down with your index finger,
My friend told me the same thing.
All right, maybe
I'll check it out.
Well, I see that it is time to go.
Do you know how I know that?
Wait a second.
Ho, ho. Look at that.
Ah. I cannot tell you how happy I am about that.
It has made my life easier.
You see?
Everything's working.
All we gotta do is fix these chairs.
I will call you first if I ever decide to go chair shopping.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rustic Canyon.
I have a reservation for David.
I'm about, uh, 20 minutes early.
Fantastic.
Ah, the rest of your party has already arrived.
It's unbelievable.
I'm here 20 minutes early, and he said you were here 10 minutes before me.
That puts you here a half hour before the reservation.
Well, you got here early, too.
Yeah, because I wanted to beat you to the good seat, cause you always have to get the good seat.
Come on, I got this fatwa.
I can't sit here with my back to the door.
That doesn't mean anything.
We'll get new silverware.
No fucking way.
You know what?
The next time we have lunch, you better set your alarm
I'm setting my alarm
Is that so?
I'll be staying up all night waiting outside that door for them to open it.
I'll be here before the owner.
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
I got perks.
Close that deal.
Ooh.
I've seen every house that's for sale in Brentwood, and I've had sex in every house that's for sale in Brentwood.
We even had sex in a house that was in escrow.
You go to these houses.
And let's say I'm driving around a different neighborhood and I see a house that's for sale, gets me kind of horny.
She is not only
You know what? Barneys is having a warehouse sale.
The fuck do you know from
Barneys having a warehouse sale?
Never thought I'd hear those words coming out of your mouth.
What do you mean, you heard?
Who would've told you that?
I don't know.
You wanna explain yourself?
Would you like to tell me what I need to explain?
Well, I just got off the phone with Jane Kleinberg and she told me she saw you in a car with another woman.
Well, do you know who that woman is?
I was surprising you by buying a house.
He was just telling me all about it, and now you ruined the surprise.
Well, that's very sweet of you.
It is very sweet of me.
How about this guy, huh?
You're a lucky woman.
I never know with you two.
He's a beautiful man.
A beautiful man.
That's right.
Hey, could you do me a favor?
I want to sit in the last row, in the seat that's closest to the door.
Can you reserve that for me?
Could you do that?
We don't save seats.
You don't save seats?
What is that?
That's a policy?
It's a memorial and that's not part of it.
You get a little paid for your trouble, huh?
It's five bucks.
Okay.
Hey.
Hmm.
Hey.
You know, this is odd, though, because when he passed me,
I gave him a very friendly hello.
I went, Hey.
And I couldn't tell if it was a typical funeral nod or if he's angry with me because I want to change the chair in the office.
Well, it seems like it would be odd for him to give you a big hello at a funeral. and needs all of his friends and family.
I'm asking for, you know, a friendly hello.
Ah. That's not big.
You know, maybe you should make it less about you.
Because you told him that I said that he likes truffles.
I got him truffle oil as a gift.
Okay, well, then, you know what?
You don't have to keep calling him Lionel.
Maybe it's getting too complicated having the same therapist.
Gotta say, you're looking sharp, sweetheart.
I like the whole look.
It holds you in, it's great.
Where'd you get that?
Barneys, you said?
Larry told you about
Barneys Warehouse sale?
Yeah.
I find that very difficult to believe.
Come over here.
Did you tell Jeff about
Barneys Warehouse sale?
What do you mean you can't say?
I can't say who told me about Barneys Warehouse sale.
I'm not at liberty to say.
It's a fucking sale, Larry.
Who gives a shit?
Just tell me who told you.
No, I will not and cannot tell you who told me about
Barneys Warehouse sale.
Larry didn't tell you about Barneys Warehouse.
That I cannot say.
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
That's it.
All right, you're a fucking liar, Jeff.
I'm not a liar.
Dr. Templeton.
Hey, you're welcome.
I take it to heart.
Glad to hear that.
You know, I noticed when I said hello to you earlier,
I gave you a very hearty hello and your response was kind of grim.
I'm not mad at you at all.
Have you considered my generous offer to go chair shopping with you?
I have considered it, yes, and I am declining it.
Thank you.
Well, you'll be making the same mistake all over again.
You'll have a substandard chair and a lot of unhappy clients.
Mrs Templeton is waiting for me.
I'd like to meet her.
I don't get that.
Well, Mrs Templeton has already indicated that she would rather not meet you.
Hmm. Well, in any event, please give my regards to Mrs Templeton.
I probably won't.
Well, if you change your mind,
Would it be all right if you continued to refer to me as Dr. Templeton?
Shalom and welcome to the celebration of life of Kenny Funkhouser.
We begin today with the traditional memorial prayer,
Kel Maleh Rachamim.
I reserved that seat.
This is a memorial service, not a Knick game.
You gotta respect the reserved sign.
This is the worst seat in the whole house.
Look. See?
It's a reserved sign. You can't just throw it on the floor.
It should say asshole, not reserved.
Do me a favor and beat it, will ya? but I got a problem with my urinary tract.
You always have to have the good seat, don't you?
Always. That was my seat.
You took it again.
You took it again.
You took it again.
The Lord is his portion.
What happened to the seat?
I know, I reserved it, but he just ignored it.
Get him outta there.
If he's mourning, it's 'cause he's losing his hair on the top.
Okay, you know what?
Forget it.
You're the last usher
I ever bribe.
Fear not death.
We are all destined to die.
Death is better than a life of pain,
Larry, do not address
Mrs Templeton.
I hope you're enjoying truffle season.
You didn't ask me to save you a seat.
I'd like to bring forward
Kenny's uncle,
Martin Funkhouser, who would like to say a few words.
Kenny Funkhouser was my nephew.
He was a golden child.
A great athlete who was going to Stanford.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.
Just whimper.
Can you whimper?
This is a day of celebrating Kenny's life.
What are you doing?
Go cry outside, for God's sake.
I can't hear a thing.
Kenny is with us.
He will always be with us.
Maybe play catch with him, even.
When we leave this service today, let's not feel sad.
Let's be upbeat, because that's what Kenny would've wanted.
He was a very happy young man.
Fatwa. He's got a gun.
Go, sweetie, this way.
Go out this way.
Go. Fatwa.
That's my friend, you idiot.
We're just gonna move through here.
Let me show you why this is your house.
Chef's kitchen, you got silent dishwashers.
It's an entertainer's dream, really.
You could entertain for 100 people here or you could entertain for two.
Pizza oven. the master bedroom?
And we could take the grand staircase or we could take the elevator.
Elevator.
This is your own little sanctuary.
Beautiful, spacious room.
Lots of morning light.
Just a great energy in here overall. come with the house?
No, the furniture is staged, but I could talk to the designer about throwing it in.
You like this bed, Jeff?
I never thought I was gonna get you down here.
Try that.
What do you think?
Let's move to another chair. this one, to me, is a perfect chair.
I think my clients would like this.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's very generous of you, Larry.
Are you expecting me to pay for this chair?
That is all the time we have.
And, well,
I'll see you next week.
And it's happening, Mr David.
There's going to be a reenactment of the Revolutionary War, which I partake in every year.
You would not believe some of the people they have.
Interesting. You're going to be in the British army?
I don't have a great British accent,
I'm thinking of two different kinds.
Tell me which one you like better.
But I don't know if that's what they do.
Gentlemen, strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight. they're both pretty good.
Make a right over here.
Right turn, got it.
Have a great day.
Fairways and greens,
Mr David. Don't forget. it's a whole conversation.
The worst mistake I ever made was rolling down that window, just to be nice.
And it's been going on for months and months.
And now, I'm in this cycle that never ends.
Once the window goes down, it cannot go back up.
I'm the only one in the club who talks to this guy.
I guarantee you. Do you talk to him?
Not for nine months. He's annoying as hell.
I think it's a big bowl of too late.
You're on your own.
Secretly,
I wish ill things on him so I don't have to do this anymore.
It's a terrible thought, but that's what I think.
By the way, where's my
I lent it to you about six weeks ago.
Just to what, to impress people?
Well, I impressed myself first that I finished it.
Of course I finished it.
I don't think you read it in the first place.
I see you've had a chance to take a look at the menu.
We do have one addition today.
What are you getting?
I'm gonna get the beet and goat cheese salad.
Okay, look, ask, but if the chef makes a face of any kind, okay, just tell him to forget it and sauté it.
Okay.
I cannot stay long.
I have to go suit shopping with my daughter
Yeah, his daughter Sammi's getting married.
You're kidding me. Congratulations.
No PTSD. He's one of the lucky ones.
Didn't make much of a face.
What kind of face is not much of a face?
Well, he can be a bit inscrutable, but I wouldn't describe it as much of a face at all.
Hmm. I'd like to see that face.
His wife just had a baby.
My greatest treasure.
You know, she looks a little Asian.
Asian look about her.
Why? What's the big deal?
What are you getting at, is all I'm asking.
Cause most people would just say, first, she's beautiful.
I'm saying that, you know, she just has a slight Asian look to her.
It's good. It's a good thing.
Look, I just wanna walk away.
I can apologize for offending you, but I can't take back the remark.
I just want you to say,
This was my fault. I apologize.
And then I can move on.
It's my fault for offending you.
I apologize. But she does look a little Asian.
She looked a little Asian.
Mr David? I need a signature.
Great. I will take this.
And I will take my pen.
Mail carrier in a long time.
I remember in my building in Brooklyn growing up, the women, they used to flirt with the mailmen.
They'd come down in the morning with their shmatas.
You know, my mother used to encourage me to work in the post office when I was younger cause she didn't think I could amount to anything.
And look what happened.
And that's not to say that you couldn't amount to anything. she felt that way about me cause she wanted me to have the security of a job, that's all, you know.
And she thought it would be easy for me.
Not that it's easy, but she thought it'd be easy for me, because it's not that much doing.
You bring mail, you drop it off.
Not big, small favor.
Is Richard Lewis on your route? He must be.
Yes. Have you been to his house yet today?
Not yet. No.
Could you drop a book off for me?
You'd need to package it up and put on a stamp.
Look, I could do that.
I mean, the idea is that you're going there.
Why not just drop the book off, do me a little favor?
It's a little favor. It's nothing. would consider that free mail, which is kind of illegal.
Don't be such a stickler. Why are you being such a stickler?
Do you think that's a good quality, stickling?
No. You know what, if you were going on a computer date, one of those things, and you put down stickler, nobody would call you.
Well, it might be why I'm still single.
Ah.
Lewis about our new kitchen?
Richie, it is massive, this new kitchen.
I mean, it is just magnificent.
You, especially, are going to appreciate it.
A red and a white, please?
Could I? Well, I think I could.
I think I could.
Thank you.
Hey, did you get the book?
She's gorgeous.
I'm thinking of making a move. to me if a woman's attractive.
All men are like that. We don't care about what they do.
We care about what they look like. Women are just the opposite.
I think you might be right.
I dated a garbagewoman. And we'd shower.
Yeah, she was great and smart but she needed the money.
She had a couple of kids.
I never even saw a garbagewoman in my life.
You make up this story to me about fucking a garbagewoman? that you would make up this story for what?
That you fucked a garbagewoman?
Why do you want me to think that?
All right, we're done. Yeah.
Hey, I got the wedding invite.
No, that was a save the date. That was not the invite.
I haven't even had them printed yet.
Larry, everybody saves dates.
I don't save dates.
The whole system's screwed up.
I just say it.
This is the way things are done, okay, asshole?
You're gonna come, and you're gonna enjoy it.
All right. Watch this.
And our neighbors, Leslie and John.
What a hero you are.
And this is our friend, Larry.
Nice to meet you.
Victor.
You didn't thank him for his service, asshole.
They thanked him. Three people thanked him. Why do I have to thank him?
Fuck, how hard would it have been? Thank you for your service.
Does everybody have to thank him for his service?
Now you've ruined everything, Larry.
I'm making all this delicious salmon, and the whole night is ruined.
Would you mind broiling mine?
Thank you for coming over in this brisk weather.
Thank you for leaving. carrying the mail bag around.
You know what you could use?
You could use a caddy on the route.
Cause you walk as much as I do on a golf course.
It'll give you instructions.
Okay, go up the path, make a right, you know, watch out for the dog.
It's, like, a little sweet and a little salty.
No, they're in cahoots.
I don't want Reese's Pieces in my popcorn.
It's the perfect movie treat, I promise.
Jean? Jean?
Jean?
Jean? Jean? Jean.
I don't understand. I've been looking for you for five minutes.
Yes, you beckon. You knew I was coming into the theater.
Just look around. I'm right here.
Just wave. Beckon.
Beckon. You gotta beckon.
Making a scene is calling out the name Jean 10 times.
Didn't have to call out my name.
I did because I couldn't find you.
What the fuck is going on here?
Okay, well, guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah, you're delivering.
Yeah.
You know what?
I think we ought to go back to our previous relationship of homeowner and mailwoman.
You know, I've gotta psych myself up for dates. It's a big performance.
Is this what you did for tonight?
Did you prepare witticisms for tonight?
No.
What, you feel we're beyond resetting?
You can't just press a button.
You can't just press a button.
That a face?
What did the face mean?
What?
What ever happened to rabbit ears?
I can't tell you how many times my cable has gone down right in the middle of one of my favorite shows.
It's one of those things.
Boom, what happens?
The cable goes down.
Do what, sir?
No, no, no, it's nothing like that at all.
I understand exactly what you're saying, Mr David.
Good day, mister.
I won't even say hurt. He's obsessed with you not thanking him for his service. that I can't quite get it out of my mouth.
Should I take him out to lunch? at the gate, the security guard?
Revolutionary War reenactment stuff.
There's one coming up
Do you have any idea how big that would be for him?
I've heard him talk about those things.
Yeah.
Sir, Mr Takahashi would like a word with you.
Okay.
Well, send him my best.
This can't be good.
I may have made a small face, probably. Sure.
You made a small face?
Would you mind showing me that face?
Eh, nobody's watching. Come on, make a face, make a face.
Wow, that's a pretty strong reaction.
Well, it was a strong request.
You know, I prepare it the way I prepare it
That's not the face that the waiter presented to me.
No, I would never make that face.
That face doesn't even communicate anything.
There was an expulsion
Had I known that you made a horse whinny with an eye roll,
I never would've told you to broil it.
Well, yes, look, there he is right here.
I remember.
What are you talking about?
And I came back and I
No. According to him,
No. I went in, and I said, Can
All right, well, it's a little confusing, I must say.
I brought you exactly what he gave me.
It's a clash of faces.
You wanna see me, Mr Takahashi?
Yes.
It has been brought to my attention that you have disgraced
I made a comment about their child.
Stop.
We will decide what punitive action to take.
A day? Two days? Four days?
All right, I'll expect a letter in a couple of days unless you tell me otherwise right now.
Go.
Go.
Hey, did you get the mail today?
Twice. No mail.
Hello. Who is it?
Of course I got the mail today.
All right, thanks.
Damn it.
We're not getting mail.
Had the same situation with a girl at Burger King.
Haven't had a Whopper in fucking three years.
Yeah. You can't go back there, right?
You can only date people you don't know and you'll never, ever see.
She has a route to do.
She fucking delivers mail.
She has a fucking route she gotta fucking hit.
They should put spite in there.
Neither rain nor snow nor heat nor spite shall keep these couriers.
That'd be cool, but that's not how this shit work.
You hit the fucking reset button.
Now look at us, no fucking mail.
You know how much shit I got coming to this house?
My DVDs, all kinds of shit comes here.
And I'll never get it now.
And now I don't know if
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Wait a minute.
You didn't tear that ass up?
No.
You didn't hit it?
And you going through the same shit if you had hit it?
Nope, nope. I didn't hit it, I didn't tap it,
I didn't tear into it, and we still get no mail.
Unbelievable.
Hey, Sal.
Hey, Sal, put the gate up?
You're supposed to get a letter?
You've hit that before, haven't you, sir?
No, you're completely forbidden from entering the premises.
You're not gonna open the gate?
You're on our list, sir.
You know what, I was the only one in this club who ever spoke to you.
Sir, please back out.
I regret every conversation
I will call security or I will deal with you myself, sir.
And now I'm being punished for it?
Sir, you can back out, please. 10 years I came up here,
I put the window down.
Back out your car, please.
Yeah, you look very honorable.
Hey, look who's here.
Good morning, Mr Franklin.
And how are you this fine day?
I am fine. And you?
Now, gentlemen, make haste slowly.
Attention, camp.
His Excellency, General George Washington.
Thank you, General, for the kind introduction.
As you were, gentlemen. And who are these fine gentlemen here?
Private Chesnik reporting for duty, sir.
Lieutenant David reporting for duty, sir.
Okay, well, are you ready to die for your country?
I'm ready to play dead for my country, which nobody could do like
I can if I put my mind to it.
Indeed, well, gentlemen,
I have lots of work to do to tend to an army,
Battalion.
Front rank, ready?
Take aim.
You got three hours to go, here.
Are you crazy? Get up. This is nuts. get back in rank. gonna have any fun.
Come on, he's not gonna have any fun.
That's not fair. It's not fair.
Let him live. Let him live.
Larry come on, get back in line.
There's a crater in the ground.
Larry. Larry. What the hell is this, man? shooting at us, man.
Ah. Incoming.
It's live rounds, Larry. guard from my golf club.
Why is he trying to kill us, man?
I told him I didn't wanna say hello to him anymore.
Aah.
How's your cat?
Hello, Sal. How you doing? hot contact. We need air now.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.
For Britain and King George.
Larry. Larry, get up, get up. Are you all right?
God, those motherfuckers.
Fuck. God damn it.
Come on. I have no idea where we are.
No idea.
You know what? I think
I know where the car is.
I think it's that way.
Yeah.
Mister Tee?
Hey, that's Mr Takahashi's car.
Who's Mr Takahashi?
What the hell is he doing here?
This is interesting, because
Do me a favor, will you call the club and tell them
Okay.
See you at the club. Take care.
I knew that baby looked a little Asian.
I don't know.
What? No, come on. It'll be fun.
Hello, Mr David. Nice to meet you.
I'm Randy. I'm new here.
How are you? I was told you'd be heading over.
Yeah.
That's how you do it. That's how you do it.
I got clothes in my locker we can wear or we could just take these jackets off.
Doesn't really matter what we're playing in.
Pull over. Pull over.
Larry, there's fucking redcoats, man.
Don't tread on me, motherfuckers.
It's your last day, you bitches.
Hey, asshole. Here's your mail.
Thank you for your service.
Synced and corrected by louvette from man or bird.
Believe him, Nejim. He means it.
He said he'd kill me.
Hey, hold that door. Hold that door. the door is locked and closed. but once the door closes, that's it.
Federal regulations.
I got caught up watching this movie in the hotel,
Loren and Gregory Peck.
But, really, it's as if the plane's not there.
If you're doing a trick, it's not a good trick.
I'm trying my best to accommodate you.
It doesn't seem like it.
You're not doing unto others as you would have others do unto you.
Unfortunately, the golden rule is not a federal regulation.
Golden rule's on top, federal law is second.
I can't wait to chomp into one of those Wetzel's Pretzels.
No, it's a full flight, sir.
Look, there's an empty seat over here. you let me know, okay?
I can pay you separately, perhaps. please, sir. Thank you.
Hey, what are you doing?
I just opened this up for me.
I don't care. That doesn't mean anything.
This is filled up. I'm using this.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It's the Wild West, okay, so.
Larry.
Ocean View, right?
That's right. We should play a round.
Okay, that's me. Thank you.
I know, but nobody's sitting there.
Sir, can I ask you a really big favor?
I have a bladder condition, and I have to get up a lot.
Is there any way I could sit in the aisle and you would want to switch to the middle?
I can't switch seats with you.
Really?
You are such a gentleman.
You're welcome.
Can I grab one of your Kleenex, please?
Oh.
No. No.
No. just have you open your eyes
If you could just try and relax a little bit.
One of our passengers has taken ill.
Hey, they're asking for a doctor.
You're not gonna heed the call?
Give it a minute. He's gonna be fine. don't even know what he has.
You ever been part of an emergency landing?
Is that what you want, Larry?
To spend the night in
Lubbock, Texas, at a Days Inn with a $15 voucher from Cinnabon?
Think about it.
Excuse me.
I'd like to use the bathroom.
Ow.
Ah. Why don't you move your foot, for God's sake?
I'll call up Marty. We'll set up a game.
By the way, that's the first time that you got up the entire trip.
That was a total bullshit story about the bladder.
She's got a medical condition.
I had to sit in the middle the entire trip because of you.
Thank you. _
Welcome back.
Nice to be home. Is that your handiwork?
Fuck, no. I wouldn't do that shit.
You know what, that's not gonna make me wash a car.
If anything, I'm not gonna wash it.
Ladies don't do that kind of shit.
Ladies bust windows out and slash tires and key your car and shit.
Wash me. This is what I'm gonna do.
You like that? See the comma after no?
Hey, did you ever see this movie Arabesque?
Nah. Is that one of those Star Trek movies?
Well, if you come across anything, let me know.
You know I'ma look.
He refused to see the person?
He did not heed the call.
I don't know what happened on the plane, but he's a great guy to play golf with.
Very surprising.
Do you care about the character of people you play golf with if they leave you alone on the course?
I'll play with reprobates. than a slow Funkhouser,
I'll tell you that.
I line my ball up, I look, I hit it.
Hey, Lar, did I tell you that we hired a decorator for the new house?
I'm going up to meet her
Sunday in San Francisco.
Jeff, you're taking me
Don't forget. Don't make any plans.
You're not going to India.
You're going to San Francisco.
See you off? You'll be back that night.
Maybe if you would've seen
Cheryl off a few more times,
Could read my mind.
You think you know what goes on in the complexities of my brain and who I am.
Who are you? You're a Jew from the Bronx.
Okay.
Please do not sit on the arm of the chair.
Dinner is served.
Thanks. the table's gorgeous.
You ever called her honey before?
I doubt it. No.
How many dates have you been on?
You just gave a premature honey.
Honey's way down the line.
I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to jump ahead with the relationship.
But it doesn't work. You got caught.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Can I take a moment, please?
On behalf of my adorable new girlfriend, thank you for a delicious dinner.
Marty, cheers.
Because it's a custom that people do,
What does it mean, the clinking?
Mmm.
Yeah, 'cause you pick up a baseball bat, you wanna swing it.
You pick up a tennis ball, you wanna throw it.
Where would the stabbing range be?
What do you think, Marilyn?
Hmm, interesting. get my potatoes like that.
What is this, tap?
Yes, it is.
No filter. Tap water.
Surprised you don't have a filter.
You have no filter.
You don't really modulate your inner feelings at all, do you?
It's a good thing for me, but it's a bad thing for water.
Goldfish would commit suicide in this water. didn't say that when she was there?
You know, I'm a guest. I don't know.
That's a movie, this is real life.
In real life, you're polite to your hostess.
Of course, you're polite.
And why wouldn't you be?
By the way, I'm not the only one who can't stand it.
Can't stand what?
Well, Marty likes my water.
You're really the only person who has a problem with the water.
You know, it's just water.
I want you to go.
Yeah, I think you should leave.
This is unbelievable. Okay.
I leave my knife and I bid you adieu. _ _
You guys, look. Ah.
Blow me, blow me.
Blow me, bald fuck.
Shut up. Shut up.
I blew it with Rhonda.
I told you it was a premature honey.
It's from Rhonda.
We need to talk.
You're done.
What ever comes good after we need to talk?
I'm taking you to Cancun.
I got an idea. Text her back.
Tell her to come meet you at the restaurant. you start calling everybody honey. the waitresses, the manager, customers, everyone. who just uses the word honey a lot.
And what would that mean to her?
That means that she's just part of the honey parade. coming. There she is.
Honey, do you mind if I grab a chair?
I just wanted to have just, like, a quick conversation.
I don't wanna interrupt a whole thing.
No, you're not interrupting anything.
A black coffee, honey.
Thanks, honey. Hey, hon.
You know, honey, can we get an extra napkin?
Thank you, honey.
Could we get the check, honey?
Pick me up at work?
Then we'll have just one car.
If you ever want any help, let me know.
Now that you mention it,
I could actually use a couple of pairs of pants.
Call me anytime. Seriously, stop by.
Do you want me to leave any money for this?
Anything you want, honey.
Oh.
You wanna go to the Rams game on Sunday with Rob?
He's got extra tickets.
I'd love to go to the
Rams game on Sunday.
She's ridiculous.
Accidental text on purpose.
Please explain.
You're sending a text to me, but it goes to her by accident.
Hey, LD, I'd love to go to the game, but I'm taking Susie to the airport.
I don't wanna disappoint her.
You, sir, are an amazing man.
I pick up a knife, I have an urge to stab.
But it's a stupid thing to say at a dinner table.
And then you made such a deal over the goddamn filter.
Okay, I've done everything
I can to get her back.
I mean, I don't know what to do.
You send me a text, but you accidentally send it to her on purpose.
Hey, Larry, you were an asshole the other night.
There's nothing wrong with her water. It's perfectly okay.
Say anything you want. Curse me, anything. I don't care.
Okay, I've never said this to you before.
I invented this. I invented this.
Damn it.
She texted me right back.
I love you.
I know this is not meant for me.
What a great man to stick up for me like that.
Yep.
Well, you're playing great today.
No, I'm having a bad day.
Beautiful.
Oh.
I got a medical emergency.
I gotta get to Cedars.
Wait, wait. What are you talking about?
You owe me $200. Pay up.
It's an emergency. I'm a doctor.
You weren't a doctor on the plane.
You know what that is?
Selective heeding, that's what that is.
You didn't get any text anyway.
It was all bullshit.
You know what, they'll usually go away, though, if you just wave them away.
Here, do you like this color?
By the way, I wanted to let you know
Well, thank you for saying so.
You know, I had no problem.
Now, I got you 32 and 30.
Look at this.
My lace just broke.
Do you have extra laces in your house?
No, nobody does.
I don't know why people don't stock up on them.
Marilyn told me she saw you in Neiman Marcus
What do you mean of course you did?
I got attacked and I pushed.
You don't push a spritzer lady.
You're out of your fucking mind.
It's a violation. You don't just go up to people and spritz them in the face like that.
It's a violation.
We have a very big problem now.
Marilyn is not happy with you.
You know what I gotta do now?
Let's hold on to that thought for a minute, okay?
I think I could fix this.
Marilyn said to me
I have to make a choice.
It's either Larry David or Marilyn.
She gave you an ultimatum?
An ultimatum.
I would've made the same decision.
I lost a brother to a vagina.
He's quite a feminist, isn't he?
Vagina got his ass.
If you communicate with him, I'm gone.
Ugh, my pants are ready.
Now I gotta go see that Rhonda.
This woman likes me. Lewis's date. with my water stance the other night and she wouldn't get out of the dressing room
Yeah, and I gotta go back there tomorrow to pick up my pants.
When women give me an ultimatum,
Who are you gonna choose, me or your friend?
I say, I'm gonna choose my friend.
I'm trying to say goodbye and end this.
Okay, goodbye.
See ya. See ya, Leon.
All right, now we just try them on.
That's not necessary.
I'll just take them.
It's just gonna take a minute. We'll be good.
These pants look amazing on you.
Right.
I think these lay great.
We have a new tailor.
He does amazing work.
Yeah, yeah.
And the hem is right.
Why was it in my face?
Because it was an accident.
It was an accidental erection.
Yeah, but just the way the Titanic went down, this thing went up.
You think I'm comfortable when you're standing in the dressing room when I'm changing my pants?
It's called a concierge service.
I've never heard of that before in my life.
I'd like you to leave, Larry.
Here.
You know, I gotta say, the waist is a little big.
Get out.
I'll wear them with a belt. I'll put a belt on.
Hi, Mrs Downing, it's Dr. Winocur.
Even though I had to cut my round of golf short,
I'm glad I saw you the other day.
Be sure to take all the medicine as I prescribed it.
They should take this guy's license away.
He was on a plane, there was an emergency, he didn't help out.
If they announced that,
Hey, we've got a passenger who has diarrhea and it's uncontrollable and it's all over the fucking place,
I don't feel like dealing with diarrhea right now. gonna have a good time. you wore. I really do.
There's Larry.
Just go inside. Ignore him.
Rhonda had nothing to do with it.
You know how these things happen.
Just like you drew a giant cock on the side of your car.
I don't know. I'm having a fight with this guy.
He's drawing stuff on my car, messages.
You think I go around drawing penises on my car?
It's either you or her.
Funkhouser's girlfriend did the same thing.
I know. Everybody has heard about it, believe me.
I call everybody girlfriend.
It's a thing of mine.
Hi, girlfriend. Girlfriend, hi.
We hit it off at baggage claim.
You hit it off at baggage claim.
By the way, I got that, uh, accidental text you sent me.
I didn't send you a text.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think you know you did.
Yeah, it was an accident,
Larry. Trust me, please.
I would be remiss if I didn't inquire about your condition.
You know, every day is a struggle.
Good to hear.
Are you sure that was an accidental text?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Are you sure you have a bladder condition?
Okay.
Thank you for coming to celebrate
Yeah, yeah. Ah.
Would you mind asking
Marty to pass the bread?
Marty, please pass me the bread. I'm famished.
Exemption denied.
Okay.
Hey, this is fun, huh?
I'm having the time of my life.
Too bad we're gonna have to leave early.
I gotta pack. San Francisco.
You think I bought that accidental text on purpose?
But, really, what they're trying to do is give you the information that they want to manipulate you with.
You did. That was a bullshit text.
Do you like my water?
I don't remember doing that.
Do you like my water?
I can't stand your water.
It's like I took a straw and put it in a frog's ass.
It makes me sick.
I wanna barf every time I get near it.
I can't stand the smell,
I can't stand the color, and I cannot stand the taste.
I can't take it anymore.
You know what, talk to him all you want.
Wow, you're the only guy at this table that could hold on to a woman. to honor Tip McDougal and his lovely wife, Nancy. member of the Ocean View family.
But he was mostly on the fairway.
Larry, I hate to even bother you with this, but I'm on in two minutes.
This guy just took my joke. Can you help me out?
What are you talking about?
This is a comedy emergency.
You didn't heed the call on the plane.
You welched on a $200 bet.
You sent me an accidental text on purpose.
I invented the accidental text, okay?
Yeah, go back to your table. Get out. Go back.
You've been drinking water all night, haven't made one trip to the bathroom.
Not one trip. I've been clocking you.
Sir. Sir. I have a condition.
Yeah, you have a condition, all right.
You're a psychopath who uses a weak bladder to take advantage of people.
But first, the funniest doc on the links,
You're gonna love this guy.
Larry. Hey. It's Dave.
It's really good to see you here, Larry.
Yeah. I love the car wash.
It's just endlessly fascinating, you know?
It comes down on a conveyer, the brushes, the water.
It's almost like it's screaming out,
Wash me.
Wash me.
And you feel a string pulling you up top, and your feet planting you on the earth.
And raise your arms up.
If you can, look up.
And come out of it.
Fantastic, yogis.
Now let's get down to the floor.
First, we'll start on our shoulders and a little shoulder stand.
Yeah.
And fold our legs over into plow.
And let's take one more breath together as a group.
Inhale.
Take one more sip of air, and down to heart's center, and namaste.
Namaste.
Thank you, yogis.
See you tomorrow.
Thank you, yogi.
I wanted to do the downward dog.
Yeah, not a namaste guy.
I don't participate in group activities.
Namaste means the light within me greets the light within you.
There is no light within me, that's the only problem there.
Well, why don't you try it?
Why don't you just try a little namaste and see how it feels?
I know how it's gonna feel.
I'm gonna feel like an idiot.
Well, no one's here now.
Why don't you just try it?
My third eye is watching.
That's not how the third eye works.
You know how the third eye works, huh?
Here, watch, here's what I think about the third eye.
Just don't do that to your third eye.
I wouldn't do it to my two eyes, the real eyes.
Right, right.
The third eye's real. imaginary eye there.
It's really hot in here.
Well, it's hot yoga.
Does it have to be this hot?
I mean, it's,
Larry, you're here to be a part of our spiritual community.
No, I'm here because
I have a bad hamstring.
If you're not gonna acknowledge the light within yourself, then you can leave.
You can leave and you cannot come back.
Wow.
That's very
Okay.
Namaste.
Nice.
Guess who just threw me out of class and told me never to come back.
Back the fuck up.
God damn it.
You see? You know what?
This is all your fault.
You fiddled with the radio and the backup camera didn't work.
No, no, no.
You fucked up.
Don't blame me for that shit.
Look at that.
That's bad.
What you gonna write?
I'm gonna tell them
Just drive the fuck off.
I'm not gonna do that.
I follow the golden rule, okay?
Do unto others as you'd have others do unto you.
My friend Jasper's golden.
Fuck them or they'll fuck you.
Yeah.
Go figure that one.
Or, oh, speaking of taste.
I have a friend who asked us a favor if I could set her up with you.
What?
What's this?
I read her chapter on verse on what an asshole you are, and what a horrible idea, but she would hear none of it.
She wants to go out with you. about the fatwa?
Yeah, and guess what?
That turned her on.
Hmm. Is she
Yeah, very pretty.
Like to see a picture.
You want to see a picture?
Who the fuck are you to ask for a picture of anybody?
You are on an Uber rating, a two.
Yeah.
I'm a four, baby.
I would kill myself. on this planet as a two.
Hi, Jeffy.
Did you call your friend
You know this Bridget friend of hers?
Yeah.
Great girl.
He would be lucky to have her,
I'll tell you that much.
And she lucky to have him. that's the pal.
What's wrong with you? talk her out of it.
I got, uh, my friend Larry.
How is it, uh, we've never met?
Why is Jeff keeping us apart?
I have no clue.
He said nothing but wonderful things about you.
I feel like
I know you already.
Yeah, he's told me a lot about you, too.
Yeah, how's it going?
Bring it by now, as a matter of fact, and we can have it hammered out maybe in the next couple days.
Wow, okay. Great.
Thank you.
What, of Bridget?
You're not getting a fucking picture. but more important, inner beauty.
That I'm not interested in. is that a problem?
Just surprised
Jeff didn't mention it.
Why would he have to mention it?
Eh, because most white people with black friends like to show off about it, that's all.
Well, I can see
I've offended you. that wasn't my intention.
There's a problem with the, uh, the fender, like I said, yeah.
And yes, there's a problem with it.
You know, we'll call you.
We'll call you.
Any loaners?
Nope.
All right.
I'll call an Uber.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah?
Well, that's very nice of you.
Ah. Bucharest?
Ah, you know
Bucharest?
Yeah, you like that, huh?
Yeah, most people would say Budapest.
If you were gonna fix me
Yeah.
Okay, I am very honest.
You are a two.
What do you think you are?
What do you think you are?
Of course.
I am honest.
I know, my face is average.
I drive Uber.
I'm a three.
Well, I completely disagree.
Excuse me, have you ever been to the beaches in Mamaia?
Have you seen the women beautiful in all of Europe. don't make me laugh.
You're thinking, maybe, of mountain women.
Okay? I am not
I'm talking about lowland women.
Women of the plains.
The most beautiful in all of Europe.
Yeah, I got your note.
I apologize.
No, you get zero credit for leaving a note.
Anyone knows to leave a note.
A real person would've hung around and dealt with this in person.
It was an accident.
Next time,
I won't leave a note. you seem like a complete garbage person.
How are you gonna pay for this, asshole?
Okay, fuckface,
I'll tell you what.
I will text you my address.
We don't need to go through insurance.
And, uh, we'll set up a time.
You'll come over and I'll give you a check. an estimate from the dealer.
All right,
Goodbye.
Fucking asshole.
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Country club.
Isn't that what it is, though?
To be honest.
What do you call it?
You try to, like, make it seem less fancy.
That's very funny.
I think the nicest thing she called you was quirky.
I see a lot of dirty words. what they try to get away with.
Yeah?
Like what?
They try to get the penises in, and the pussy.
Wet pussy, tight pussy, hot pussy.
You know, cock, balls, tits.
You know, and after a while, at the end of the day,
I just give it to them.
I can't fight off the penis forever.
Let it just slip right in.
Okay.
What a fantastic date.
The conversations just move and move.
Great.
In fact, if I were to go home and get a phone call from a friend, okay?
Larry, hey, I heard you went out on a date.
Really?
Fantastic?
Not kidding.
And you know what?
She wears glasses.
I love glasses on a woman. and smart, sexy.
I'm a little smitten.
I'm a little smitten.
Larry, I haven't
You know, a couple of things.
Of course, nobody's perfect. a strange way of holding silverware like a pencil.
She holds it like a pencil.
That I've never seen before. the window open in the car. the big question tonight was,
Moves, they're tough.
How do you do it?
It's a very difficult thing.
Who are you?
Oh.
Ah. Hi.
Eddie, this is our friend Larry. a very good question, Eddie.
Very good question.
I don't know.
Okay, honey.
Now, come on. go grab a snack.
You know, and that was the end of the night, pretty much.
He has Asperger's.
Ah, Asperger.
Why are these chocolate sprinkles?
I only eat rainbow sprinkles.
Hey, it was really fun.
Yeah. Nice. Okay. find the door.
I'm coming, honey.
Why didn't you tell me he was black?
What does it matter?
No, it doesn't matter at all.
You know, cause when I got there,
What were you surprised about?
What are you doing up here?
Mrs Cleaver hated Eddie Haskell cause Eddie Haskell obsequious, little shit.
I think he had access to the house.
But that's because the boys were upstairs.
I want the same privileges as Eddie Haskell.
What are you doing here anyway?
You should be lucky that I even did that for you.
Really like her.
She had a good time.
Aw.
My heart is breaking.
All right, go.
Just leave.
Okay, but I can't get home.
Yeah, well, walk.
Get the fuck out. Go now.
Has Jeff seen you in those curlers of late?
Get. Out.
The hell is this?
Took quite a while.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know,
I pick up four, five stars.
I know they're gonna be responsible, respectful of the car, not be a problem.
I'm not one star. but Uber says you're a one, buddy.
Holy shit.
Four other stars next to it, not filled in.
The Romanian. and took me down from a five to a one.
Man.
What the hell is going on in here?
You're damn right it's 92 degrees.
Tina came over.
Like that shit hot.
She's up there fuckin' recuperating.
What are you doing in my house?
I'm in here fuckin at 92 degrees.
Well, you already did it, right?
I didn't do part two or three yet.
Okay, there's not gonna be a part two or three, okay?
I'm not gonna sit here and leave her at fuckin' part one.
Well, why is it 92 degrees?
She's a yoga instructor.
That's fuckin' right.
That's what the fuck she does.
I want you out of the house. walking around my house, okay? there's nothing wrong with people having of fuck on their body.
I don't like the scent of fuck, okay?
Sue me.
I don't like fuck scent.
He said your car's gonna be ready in three weeks.
Three weeks? On the phone, he said a couple of days. like he was ticked off?
Jews, I could tell within, like, a minute. and I could tell you if they're reform or conservative.
How's the temperature?
Is it to your liking?
Ha, ha, is it?
Namaste.
Okay.
Now get the fuck out.
I'm still gonna
Tell you that.
Hold on.
Hold on, baby.
Let me talk to you real quick.
They better have a cheeseburger, no condiments.
Wow.
Free.
He'll be fine once we get to the restaurant.
Huh.
A one?
You gave me a one? you insulted the lowland women of my country, okay?
They're not the most you want me to pull up pictures for you?
I've seen plenty of pictures of Romanian women.
And the Bulgarians, and the Hungarians.
No beauties.
Come on.
First of all, do you hear yourself talking?
You are the rudest person
I've ever met.
Who's angry?
You're the one who's angry, not me.
I am not the one insulting your culture, your country, your women.
I gave you a five.
I gave you a five.
Of course, because
I gave you nice service.
I take you where you want to go, quickest route.
Okay, look, look,
I wanna ask you a favor, okay?
You want me to go into the algorithm and change it?
Of course.
What are you writing over there?
I wanna see what you're writing.
I'm not giving you my cell phone.
Don't touch my cell phone.
All right, you know what?
I'm changing my rating of you.
From a five to a zero.
Go ahead because Uber ratings are final, my friend.
You know what
I regret the most?
When I said to you,
If you were gonna fix me up with your sister,
My sister would not look at a picture of you.
And I'm telling you,
I don't think
Bridget's kid has Asperger's.
I swear to God,
I just think he's an asshole. of people with Asperger's, I do.
And you know what, they're delightful people.
This kid,
I'm betting you're right.
You know, to be honest with you,
I'm gonna start telling people that you're on the spectrum. can be written off as what?
Hello, hello, hello.
It's hot as fuckin' hell in there, Larry.
Well, I know.
And the heating guy's here.
He's fixing it.
Well, listen,
Huh?
What do you got?
There you go.
Now you're talking.
But that prick son is driving me crazy.
Ugh, you know what, you've never had children.
Every single time you deal with a woman with kids, you have a problem.
I suggest you foster a kid.
I'll go down to the pound today.
I'll go down to the foster pound.
Would you come with me to the foster pound?
Always looking forward for a trip to the foster pound.
Yeah, it's, like, stuck on 92 degrees.
How's it looking?
Do you specialize more in heating than heat and AC.
If I called you up and said
I have a particular problem, would you prefer if I said
No preference at all. You know, they're
Okay, like children.
You have two children,
You have to pick one, the one you had an infinity for, and the other one goes into the concentration camp. which one you gonna keep?
Heat.
You know, our AC isn't working that well either.
What she see's in him,
I have no idea.
Hey. Hey.
How long is this gonna take?
What you have is a cooling problem.
You sent the cooling kid to the concentration camp.
Okay, it's not a kid, okay?
It's chlorofluorocarbons. they're not children.
I did not send a child to a concentration camp.
Yeah, you know,
Now the window's closed.
Well, I'm not gonna have sex
You get all sweaty.
The sweat's on the sheets,
I have to take my shirt off.
I'm not gonna have sex with my shirt off.
You don't take your shirt off during sex?
I love it.
I get completely free.
All right.
Yeah, I did. she can't come over.
I got it.
I'm Justin.
I didn't know you were black.
No, like, that could literally not matter less.
I got from the dealership, but, uh, it seems high.
That was really considerate.
Thank you.
Wow.
Gotta love 'em.
Namaste.
Namaste up in this mother fucker.
Hey, Greg.
I just came to apologize for the other day.
Thing is tell you was that
I have Asperger's.
You have
Asperger's? Ah.
Jeff never mentioned anything,
Why would he need to? he doesn't need to.
I'm on the spectrum.
I have no filter.
I say whatever comes into my head.
You know, I have trouble making eye contact.
We'll have the car ready for you tomorrow.
It's just a ding.
Free of charge.
What?
What? What?
Car will be ready when?
Tomorrow.
I'm a good driver.
I'm a good driver. motherfucker.
You know?
Your body's not used to that kind of temperature. _
I haven't had sex with her yet.
She invited me over to her house.
Fuck, I don't have a car.
I need to borrow your car.
You ain't borrowing my car.
You're not gonna give me your car?
No. You're not getting my fucking car.
No, no, no.
Use the guest house.
You think I'm gonna go in there?
There must have been 10,000 ejaculations in that place in just two years.
That means that room is broken in.
It's ready.
It's prime and ready to fuck.
Okay, fuck that.
All right, I'll tell you what.
Okay, I'll tell you what. get me an Uber.
You gonna bring my rating down.
I'm a good five right now.
Yeah, well, that's 'cause one idiot changed it to a one.
You don't know how to respect people.
And your friendship rating just went down.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
Does this go to
Olympic and Hauser?
What are you sitting in the middle for?
Why don't you move over one?
Okay, or whatever you're saying, a little strange.
I've never seen a person sit in the middle.
It's like using the middle urinal.
No, no, you go over there.
No, you sit there.
No, no.
Sir?
Olympic and Hauser?
I'm supposed
Yeah, well, that's easy, man.
Get off at the La Cienega stop.
You got a couple options.
Okay, will you tell me
Figure it out.
This bus is a very cold, unforgiving place.
I don't like it one bit.
Does this go to
Olympic and Hauser?
There you go. but can you do me a favor and get behind the yellow line for your safety? and maybe go a little faster than you normally might? do you that favor. to ignore the yellows.
Sir, I'm not ignoring any yellows.
People pay a little too much
I am driving this bus.
I don't wanna hear no more back talk.
You gonna make me crazy now.
Do you wanna drive this bus, sir?
I'ma need you to go and sit the hell down.
This is danger.
Come and sit.
Hey, this is none of your business, okay?
Sit your ass down.
Get behind the yellow line and sit down.
Shit.
No shit, Sherlock.
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Terrible.
People don't appreciate them anyway.
The whole reason
I hit this car talking in my ear,
Go through the yellow light.
You bus people are starting to get on my nerves, okay?
That's it.
Get the fuck off the bus. hey, what are you doing?
I have Asperger's.
I'm on the spectrum.
If I see you on my bus again,
I'ma fuck you up.
Okay.
Come on, now.
I'm not gonna do that.
Sync and corrections by n17t01
Come on.
I can't look at that.
Take it away.
No one wants to see this.
It's very disturbing.
Two people aren't allowed to be happy?
All the lights in here and in the hallway, they're all fixed.
I cannot accept that money.
This is my job.
This is what I do.
This is rarer than a man turning down sex, what you've just done.
Okay, Señor Larry.
I've never turned down sex in my life.
Me neither.
Funkhouser's gotten back together with this woman.
Just because of the tap water?
Hey, Eddie, breakfast.
Wow, tap water.
Here you go, sweetie.
Wow, look at the young man today.
Very nice hoodie you got there.
Mom, you're still dating this guy?
It's right there, quite visible.
I can't see the butter.
Do it again.
He needs to see the butter.
I'll eat this one and I'll make you another one.
It's not really your business, but to tell you the truth, it's imminent, okay?
I wanted to ask you a question.
Please say no if this is at all inappropriate, but Susie happened to mention this very same school, Pemberton Academy, where I'm trying to get him in.
You had donated some
Seinfeld stuff there.
My assistant takes care of all that. I just, you know.
Nah, I really don't.
You know, I feel weird about sending him to boarding school anyway.
I actually think it would be the best for him, but it would be hard for me
I think it would be a fantastic thing for him.
That's really nice of you, Larry.
That would be kind of hideous, wouldn't it?
Have you ever seen a couple with the same glasses?
By the way, when I say couple,
I'm not referring to us as a couple.
We don't have it like that just yet, my friend.
Still or sparkling?
Ugh, boy, I can't tell you,
Yeah, they're a great school.
Has he been diagnosed by a doctor, or is this your opinion?
How do you know?
Okay.
Oh. it's Cesar from the office.
You gave me the tip and I didn't take it?
Yeah?
I'm here at the office building, fixing a leak, and I was just wondering, after I'm done,
I could go to your office and watch the Argentina and Mexico game.
Because you got all the channels, sir.
I will not forget this.
Water is water.
We're not water snobs.
While you bring the tap, bring us the best bottle of champagne you have in the house to drink.
Okay?
We're gonna live it up.
Yeah, you know, sure.
Thank you, Larry.
I really appreciate your apology.
Tap water for the table.
Look at this.
Look at this beautiful tap water.
Ah, it really looks good.
You can't just walk up here.
Come on, man, you're being rude.
One minute. Just a minute.
Are you getting seconds?
Yes, sir.
The man is getting seconds.
The man has already waited on this line.
I'm hungry, too.
But to make him wait another 10 minutes for a few measly potatoes?
That's not how we do things here in America.
We don't wait for seconds.
Never, never wait for seconds.
It's fine, it's good. It's fine.
Sir, I would be proud to serve you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Ah.
I mean, the good thing here is that if we want seconds,
I like ketchup.
I mean, you use too much ketchup, you know what happens?
I wasn't saying there's a ketchup shortage, it's just that if everybody uses as much ketchup as you do, they would stop buying it.
As a matter of fact,
I think I need more ketchup.
Mmm.
Why are we talking about this?
There's no way she could finish all that ketchup. Is there?
Watch me.
Let's just change the subject, okay?
That's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay. Yeah, your sweater covers it fine.
I'm gonna go home.
I'm just feeling very uncomfortable.
It's a go home stain, you know what I mean?
It was lovely to meet you.
You seem lovely.
Nice job, once again.
That was a disgusting display.
You couldn't let the ketchup go.
Guess what.
Who's paying for the expensive champagne?
You had already waited.
What was the point of going back again?
You would've lost your appetite.
I agree with you, Mr David.
How do you know my name?
I know everything about you.
I was sitting there having my brunch, and I saw you.
And I was thinking, as a devout Muslim,
I should kill this man.
Fatwa.
And then you defended me.
I cannot kill this man.
This man doesn't deserve to die.
No. No, I don't. I don't.
I think I need to bring to their attention that you are not the man they think you are.
Anything you want to know,
I'll give you full access.
I'm an open book.
You will be hearing from me.
My name is not important.
What guy?
Oh.
Let's go.
Huh.
That was a lot of fun.
I was excited for you.
It's been incredibly fun.
Believe me, once I get through with those Pemberton people, they're gonna beg this kid to go to that school.
Because I'm feeling pretty grateful.
You know what,
But people tell me that gratitude sex is the ultimate.
It's hard to explain.
I'd rather just show you.
Nancy put you to bed.
She did.
Well, it's time for bed.
It's past your bedtime.
Go to your room, okay?
I'll hang out in my room, but I'm not going to bed.
I've never seen an old man in sneakers before.
Ah, the spectrum.
Guess that's that.
The offer still stands.
All right, you little prick, okay?
You got it?
Now get under those covers.
You're gonna go to sleep, and I'm gonna have sex with your mother.
Hello.
There was nothing I could do.
Quite an expensive bottle of champagne
I wound up paying for.
We ordered the champagne because you wanted to live it up.
You said, Let's live it up.
I would never live it up.
I live it down,
I don't live it up.
Okay, maybe I said,
For leaving me with the bill?
Here's $250 for the champagne.
My apology is from the heart.
Why do you come to the office to apologize without offering the money?
Because I felt bad.
If you feel bad, you offer the money.
Feeling bad is feeling in the heart, not in the wallet.
Well, to come here and apologize without taking your wallet out and offering, who knows if I would even accept it?
There's not even an offer.
Let's go to lunch, talk it over.
I gotta take a quick piss.
I want to thank you for offering me to watch the game on your TV.
Ah, well, you're very welcome.
Yeah?
Can I bring my family there for a nice little swim?
Little Cesar's like Aquaman.
I don't understand your lack of generosity.
Lack of generosity?
What are you talking about?
I gave you a tip, which you turned down.
I already repaid you a favor that I didn't even owe you.
The whole point of the tip is for you to be indebted to me.
Now I'm indebted to you.
You flipped it.
You flipped the tip.
I promised Little Cesar.
All right.
This is the last one.
Okay? This is it.
And next time I give you a tip, you take it, okay?
You can't swim there.
They're racist.
They're not gonna let you in there.
Why are you a member of a racist club?
They're all racists.
That's the way they operate.
I bet you have friends with nice pools.
Yeah.
Can Cesar and his family use your pool?
Nice to meet you, Cesar.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Can he use my pool?
At this time of year, we might have family coming over.
We call it even, the $250.
What time is good for you?
No diving, and try to stay in the shallow end, okay?
Gracias.
Larry David paid you for your services?
Hell, yeah, he did.
Hell, no.
He could've had all this.
I still don't understand.
How can your father be a kamikaze pilot when he's still alive?
He grazed the ship.
Grazed, but not fatal.
No.
Yeah. I didn't want him to.
At least.
Commendable.
I'd see Larry occasionally.
I guess you would say
Yes. It's big.
Big enough to steal a Mickey Mantle autographed baseball?
He took a word in one of my rhymes and changed that shit.
And it opened up lyrically for me.
It was amazing, man.
And according to Jewish law,
Big time.
And I explained to him,
I have these shoes, these heavy shoes that I wear because my feet get cramped.
And they make noise.
I invite him in.
A little bit.
Yeah.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
I pass, sir.
Pussy.
Larry, thank you for all of the Seinfeld scripts and memorabilia that you've donated to our fundraisers.
You know what?
I just feel like I'm ignoring you all the way on that side.
Wherever you want to sit is fine. Please.
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
I actually would prefer to sit over there, but, you know.
Okay, all right, okay.
Thank you.
Actually, more like a foster child who comes to your house, and all of a sudden, you go,
What the hell did I do?
That's how I feel now.
Bridget is Eddie's mother, and she's your girlfriend?
I don't know, but she does have tampons in my house.
We were happy to do a favor for you, Larry.
Sure.
We just wanna make sure that it's just not a fling.
We're just interested in where you see this relationship going.
Yeah, the relationship going.
I don't know.
You know, they're kind of tough.
You go away for a weekend with your friends on a trip to Vegas, you come back, she says,
Did you had fun?
You got to lie, say,
No, no, I didn't have fun.
No, no, it wasn't fun at all.
Worst trip I ever made in my life.
Then she talks to one of your friends and they say they had a fantastic time.
She comes back to me, she says,
Your friends said you had a great time.
I can't sleep with the same bed with anybody.
It's, ugh, a horrible night's sleep.
I'm off in a corner like this.
You know, 'cause I don't want another body touching mine when I'm trying to fall asleep.
And you can't turn this way because
You don't wanna do that in the middle of the night.
I see it going, hopefully, one day, to the point where I'll let her sleep in the guestroom.
I can give you nine months.
Nine happy months.
But we'll be together.
Well, that's actually really what we're looking to hear, Larry, is that you are gonna be together for an extended amount of time.
I'll leave her quickly.
You could understand that.
I'm not gonna visit people in the hospital.
I adore this woman.
Excuse me.
Hello.
All right, I'll make it quick.
I'm very disappointed.
And I'm sure Cesar will be, too.
And Little Cesar.
I don't know Little Cesar and
I don't really know Cesar.
Okay, I'll see you then.
All right.
I think look pretty good.
Could my handyman and his family use your pool on Saturday?
This time we'll drink it.
What's the matter?
I just got off the phone with the Pemberton Academy.
What'd they say?
Eddie didn't get in.
Why?
Because of the condition that your handyman and his family left the Pemberton
Academy pool.
What? What's the condition?
Befouled.
Little Cesar befouled the pool?
Why would you send them there?
Of all the pools in California?
I don't know, 'cause Little
Cesar wanted to use a pool.
Why do they have to use a pool at all?
What a day.
We just came back from Catalina.
How are you guys doing?
No, don't do that.
I'll see you, maybe, again, but who can say?
Enjoy the champagne.
Oh.
Mr David, get in.
Get in.
Go.
As I said, I had already waited, and those brunch buffet lines are interminable.
Yes, I am familiar because they cook the eggs while you wait.
Ah, yes, home fries.
A nice compliment to the eggs.
With ketchup?
Yes, of course.
Why even get them?
But the outcry was unlike anything you could ever imagine.
You are perceived as a cutter.
There's nothing Americans hate more than a cutter.
You're right, Mufti.
He said I have every right to get seconds without waiting.
He was forceful, passionate, and courageous.
When the American blood sugar gets low, they turn into animals.
It's very intimidating.
Not this man.
And that's why
I come before you to beg you to reevaluate his case.
I have read the report of your investigation with great interest.
However, there are many things in his past which contradict his behavior in the restaurant.
For example, this business about not giving out candy on Halloween.
Surely that cannot be justified.
With all due respect, he did give out candies.
But the girls in question, they were teenagers.
Much too old to be tricking.
Tricking or treating?
Well, you play tricks if you don't get the treat, is my understanding.
Yes, I believe that is correct.
That is confusing.
But the girls were 16.
You don't trick when you're 16.
That's not tricking, that's stealing.
By denying them candy, he was teaching them a lesson.
Yes.
I see your point.
Ah, very good. Very good.
Pass the plates, gentlemen.
But what about his values?
His lust knows no bounds.
He will have sexual congress with anyone, anytime.
Including a Palestinian.
What? Is this true?
This is so?
You know this for a fact?
Twice.
Twice.
A Muslim woman?
Yes, Mufti, she is a Muslim.
Very interesting.
This is new information.
I can say without reservation that he will rescind the fatwa.
Thank you all, or moofti?
Moofti.
Thank you, Moovtis.
Yes. I love Hamilton.
If you can get you can proceed with the musical.
He's not gonna be in this.
What are you doing with the ketchup?
You used up all the ketchup.
You're never going to eat all that.
Is there a shortage of ketchup that I was not aware of?
This is why I have been advocating for packets, but no one will listen.
The whole snack is ruined.
You're being a baby.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
No, I can't take that.
I don't want it.
I can't take that from you, sir.
I will not take this tip, okay?
Take the money.
None of it would have happened if I didn't intercede on that guy's behalf in the restaurant.
None of this would have happened.
The fatwa is over.
Let's drink to that, huh?
It's a new me. It's a new me.
Well, whatever. We're glad you're back, Larry.
I didn't even tell you the biggest news.
Fatwa. the Musical is back on.
We're having a meeting with
It's the only way it can go
Aren't they doing the show here?
Yeah, they're doing Hamilton.
Yeah, can you get us tickets?
I mean, it's here.
No, it's here and we can't even get tickets to it.
Already with the Hamilton tickets?
Are you kidding?
I don't know if I can get you tickets.
Incredible.
Only you would fall asleep at the hottest show on Broadway.
It's all good? No grit?
Just shuck and awe.
Okay, well, that's great. bunch of bluepoints.
Fantastic. Cute as could be. about me sleeping through Hamilton.
What do you care?
What difference does it make?
I just hope it doesn't
I doubt that, Larry. You're paranoid.
He shucks all over town. I don't know what circles he shucks in.
He could shuck and tell.
Who's ringing the bell this time of night?
Hello, I'm Rose Shapiro. Remember me?
No.
Well, I won't take but a minute.
I lived here for 50 years.
Raised all my children here.
Is that okay?
But it can't be too long, though, okay?
It won't be, I promise you.
I'll be very discreet.
What have you done here?
You've covered up that cut stone from Italy with a rug.
Yeah, well, it needed a little warming up in here.
It was very cold and I happen to like it.
And you know what? It happens
And what have you done in here?
Where's the wonderful wallpaper I put up?
The wallpaper with the pirates?
Are you kidding?
It was the first thing
I took down when I moved in.
Well, I guess it's your house.
You can do anything you want to. do anything I want to.
I'm checking the master bedroom.
I don't want you to. It's my house.
Well, all right.
If you wanna be that way.
Yeah, I think I do wanna be that way.
I do. All right, you know what?
I think it's time to go.
Let's go. Come on.
Look at this poor ficus.
What have you done?
I left this with you in good faith to love and cherish.
Yeah, no, I've taken very good care of it.
You've got to go. Come on.
There's the door. Time to go. Thank you.
And then, Todd, this other guy, equivalent of bush?
And then I'm, like, looking.
I've been hearing them for years.
What are you doing?
You come in here and you're criticizing my house.
You don't live here anymore.
That's right, keep going.
Yeah, and now close it.
Close it.
The Leaning Tower of Peter? and he was a biter, too.
Well, that's it, everybody.
Thanks. It's been a privilege working for you tonight.
And I hope you agree with me that this has been it was great having you here tonight.
Everybody really enjoyed it.
Sure. What I heard was that you fell asleep.
You can paint it or dress it up anyway you want, but sleep is sleep.
I think that's enough.
We're having afterdinner conversation, Larry.
I don't like all the lingering after dinner. the hell out. Come on, get out.
All right, thank you for ruining a lovely evening.
On the contrary, didn't ruin it.
Saved it.
All right, okay, come on.
Time to go, people.
How about that?
Look at me. I'm the sheriff.
Now let's go home, Sheriff. Come on.
She's showing me love and affection that I've never felt before.
She listens to what I say.
She takes suggestions.
She's got a real perversion, doesn't she?
Yeah, she loves the Old West.
Where are the women who have a bald perversion?
I wonder if there's, like, a place they all hang out.
You just walk in and, you know.
I wonder if it's worth investigating.
You wonder?
I would have already investigated it.
Hmm, I hadn't thought of that,
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Lin isn't here yet, but if you'd like to go upstairs to Aaron's office, you can.
Oh.
Ma'am.
How you doing?
Come on in, come on in. Jeff, hi.
I like it. I like how you think.
Lin's very excited, by the way.
We're really excited, seriously.
And you think that he's interested
What's that? Judge Judy?
If I ever had to go to court,
I would like for her to adjudicate.
Jeff, Lin. Larry, Lin. Nice to see you.
All right, I was just telling them how excited we are.
You know, I loved Hamilton, needless to say.
You know, I know the show's in LA right now. Everybody's loving it.
I was wondering, would it be possible to get two tickets for my shucker?
For your shucker?
Like an oyster shucker?
Yeah, yeah, oyster shucker. Yeah.
Hey, if he's important to you,
All right, I'll let you chat together, and my office is your office.
Have a great time.
I'm excited about this.
Thanks for letting us use the office.
Appreciate it. Let's have a seat, guys.
Where do you guys wanna do it?
Broadway? All right.
I think you're gonna wanna try it out of town first.
You know, why not LA?
I think you should do it here.
And who do you see for a cast?
Yeah, Salmon Rushdie.
Salmon, yeah.
This is really going well. Hello?
What the hell's wrong with you?
What the hell happened?
Yes. It's the power of the desk.
He's up high, I'm down low.
Everything he says, I say yes to.
He's in the boss chair.
We gotta do everything we can to get him out from behind the desk.
Please, make yourselves comfortable.
I got an idea.
Why don't you sit over here?
Yeah, no. I'm comfortable.
I gotta tell you, we could have a real nice, intimate discussion over here.
You know, we'll be able to kind of really kick it around.
Yeah, I feel like we're at a nice, wide angle. view of the piece.
Well, I'm enthusiastic about it, too.
I think we're on the same page.
Listen, not only do I wanna play
You know, what you've written
It's a great foundation
You know, let's start with the opening.
What? The opening?
Come on, the opening's terrific as is.
No, I was just checking out the whole area here.
No, have a seat. I'm not done.
Yeah. No, have a seat over here.
Yeah, right where you were.
Have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
We're in a flow right now.
You're doing great.
Listen, I feel like
I have a lot of ideas and maybe we should call another meeting where I can really download everything that's in my head, cause I'm just scratching the surface here.
Okay.
Great.
I have a couple of calls to make to the West End before it closes.
Yeah, all right, give me the room.
Thanks.
Ugh, how can you eat that thing, Riggs?
Hey, it's breakfast, the most important meal of the day.
What's the name of this show?
It's not that bad.
People will watch anything with Chicago in the title.
Yeah.
Ow. Could this couch be any more uncomfortable? up the stairs, lugging this out.
I can't stand to see people doing manual labor in front of me.
I wouldn't get a piano just because
Interesting, the things I'm learning.
Just like talking to all your friends the other night.
Susie loves those stories.
Well, I won't talk about you, Larry.
Don't worry.
Is there anything you've observed thus far or noticed that you might wanna talk about at a dinner party?
No. Everything's completely just regular.
They're too much trouble.
I'm officially done dating.
I'll just rent a penis.
It's Bridget for Bill.
No, he knows why I'm calling.
Yeah.
No, tell him I'm holding for him.
Don't let him get away.
What? What are you doing here?
Well, obviously, I'm keeping this plant alive.
I have my own keys.
You forgot to change the locks.
Okay, I want that key back, okay?
And you need to go.
This is not a college dormitory where you can visit years later and catch up on things.
You're destroying it and you're certainly destroying this plant.
Okay, you listen to me,
Shapiro, all right?
It's not your house. It's my house.
I live here, not you.
What a fucking psycho.
Fuck me, Tex.
You know how she got in?
I'm going for the whole thing.
Women love it. They go nuts.
The only downside is I gotta keep fucking my wife.
Yeah. Hey, we gotta talk about
Well, you just don't wanna piss him off, that's all I can say.
He's taking over the whole goddamn thing.
Just gotta keep it down.
Everybody's got such a big mouth.
Yeah, you can pull that off.
Yeah, I don't know why I bother, though.
Yeah, it's enough with the acting already.
How long do you have to do it for?
Every time I turn on the television, I have to see you.
It's enough. Retire.
Why don't you retire?
We gonna see you this weekend?
This is developing. I like it.
It's working really well. Keep workshopping. It's great.
They weren't able to do it.
You'd go as my guest. It's my pleasure.
Well, he's not just good at
Again, for you, no problem. In a second.
Anytime you wanna go, please let me know.
Okay. Yeah, okay, I'll go.
You'll be there at the show?
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Are you really sure?
I'm really sure.
You can have it for your meeting.
I like it okay. Getting used to driving.
No, not in New York, but I have one here I've been renting.
Yeah, I'm getting used to the traffic.
Yeah, have a seat, guys.
I had a couple of questions about act two and a couple of ideas that I think are really gonna help us.
You know, there's always a bit of a drag in the middle of act two and I think we can attack that in a really innovative way.
Lucy?
Come on, Larry. Spit that shit out.
What happened in Tahoe?
Listen, you can ask as many questions as you want.
You are not going to find out from me what happened in Tahoe. to find out, go ask Ted Danson.
There's just no discretion anymore.
I had to give that fucking shucker two tickets to Hamilton.
Who knows if he's gonna keep his trap shut? you were at the table the other night. what she was going on about.
She could be talking that way about me.
What do you mean, like a nondisclosure agreement?
Fucking nondisclosure.
Make her sign that shit.
You know, they have it for housekeepers. can't talk about it.
They should have that for sex.
They should have it for sex, but they don't.
I'm done.
Susie sprained my dick.
You know how many times
I fucked my dick up?
It's the worst thing
I've ever experienced.
I'm taking these. I'm popping these.
This just cuts the pain.
Those are really strong.
Take them only if you need them.
Hey. Great news.
I forgot to tell you the good news.
The good news is I talked to his agent. you, I said it was a sure thing.
He's getting everything he wants.
Why shouldn't he be in?
I got Funkhouser invested.
I got Lewis invested.
Of course, I'm still invested.
She took the plant. foot on the door, but that's still a home invasion.
Yeah. No, I know what it is,
You know, she's mental.
A home invasion's a fucking home invasion, you know?
That's a home invasion.
She came in your house without permission.
Black man showing up
It's in the same family as a scarf, as a ascot, as a pocket square. that's in the scarf, ascot, pocket square family.
The same goddamn family.
Are you kidding me?
I don't like the optics.
She's gonna be fine. I promise you, man.
Fuck that. Knock on that shit aggressively.
You came to my house and you stole my plant. Come on.
I'm saving this plant.
I'm letting it live and flourish.
Oh.
See, my dog doesn't like you at all.
Bella will bite you on the ankles.
I'm not taking turns.
I'm not walking the dog.
You gonna pick up its shit? say when they wanna get a dog.
I'll take care of it. And they don't do a goddamn thing.
Wait, who's that?
That's Myron, my dearly departed husband.
You know what? Let's take his hat.
No, you're not taking his hat.
No, take the whole goddamn head.
Take the whole fucking head.
I'm not gonna take the head. I don't want that monstrosity in my house.
He's not a five.
Okay, you know what?
You haven't heard the last of me about this, all right?
Don't go into people's homes and steal their plants.
Hello?
From Jeff already, but I'm in.
It's gonna be you and me writing this thing toe to tip.
You know what, Lin, I think we're in pretty good shape.
We don't need to get into the weeds on this thing.
You can get Lyme disease in there if you're not careful.
There's treasure in the weeds and we'll pick for ticks after.
The verses are gonna be satanic. is that my wife, Vanessa, and her friend are gonna be at Hamilton the same night as you.
She's going?
Yeah, well, if she's going, she'll see me because I'm going.
Of course. The ticket's for you.
Yes, you got the ticket for me the ticket you got for me,
I'm really excited for you guys to meet.
Fatwa. See you in the weeds, buddy.
Ah, Shucker.
No, I'll be right there.
Yeah, why wasn't I invited?
You just had dinner at my house.
Where's the reciprocity?
Well, I'm gonna reciprocate, but not this one.
You're gonna reciprocate? This was the opportunity to reciprocate.
Come to the party. I want you to come in and really warm it up. wanna go to the party.
Leading me to believe that you discussed it with him.
No offense to you, but Ted and I don't need to sit around talking about what you and
I did in hotel rooms.
I just don't understand why you're talking Tahoe to Ted.
That is mentioning a trip that's about to happen.
More shooting? Another job?
When's it gonna end?
Shucker from your party.
Ah, I gotta talk to him.
I just wanna thank you for those Hamilton tickets.
Ted is shooting a limited series in Vancouver.
I'm borrowing your Shucker for two minutes.
Ma'am.
There it is.
Well, got my hat.
Thanks again for those tickets.
Yeah, that's kind of what
I need the tickets back.
Because if she sees you there,
I am gonna be in a lot of trouble.
For $2,500.
Take it or leave it.
You're quite a prick, aren't you?
It's the Shucker's way.
I don't have that kind of cash on me.
It's okay, we take credit cards.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Jarvis isn't living up to his potential.
What's on?
Oh.
I mean, if we could do anything right now, what would it be?
Sexually.
I just like to get an erection, put it in a vagina.
That's about it, yeah.
That's your biggest fantasy?
I would just get on the top and thrust until orgasm.
Oh.
Hmm.
There you go.
This is a relationship nondisclosure agreement?
No, no. that you want me to sign?
What's wrong with you?
This has never existed before.
What are you talking about?
It'll be great for our sex life. wish I thought of it years ago.
I wish my exwife had signed one, I can tell you that.
Cause I know she's talking, she's blabbing.
She's told him what happened in Tahoe.
It's the least sexy thing anyone has ever done, ever.
You're not thinking this through.
Bridget. Bridget.
Bridget, if we had this, it'll take the boredom away.
Sign this and you'll have the wildest sex you ever imagined.
That's what I'm promising you, baby.
Orgasms galore. You won't regret it.
I'm not signing your dumb piece of paper, Larry.
Should've known this was not gonna work out.
Eddie never liked you. you pretended has Asperger's?
It is not pretend. He has Asperger's.
What's your excuse?
You're missing out on Tahoe Larry.
You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin.
This is Judge Judy.
Larry David is suing Rose Shapiro for trespassing at his home and stealing his ficus plant.
Larry David says that Mrs Shapiro has made him feel unsafe in his own home.
Parties have been sworn in.
Subsequently, several weeks ago, you, without invitation,
That's him.
That's the guy. That's the guy I was telling you about.
This is the guy you had all those sex stories about?
Yes, that's Larry Long Balls.
Finally, I shoo her away.
She comes back another time, uninvited, uses her key, steals the plant.
This is the way the plant looked when I found it in his house.
Who are you?
This is Leon Black.
Does he have any relevant information
That would help your case?
I do. This plant is like a person.
Certain parts of the year, that plant turns darker, like myself.
When I go to Florida, I turn a little darker, a shade darker.
Most of the time I carry myself in a mocha tone, the year when I'm more mahogany.
Your Honor, is it possible I could pace while you're asking me the questions?
Would you put him in his seat?
You have another exhibit underneath that to show me what the plant looks like now?
You want one, Judge? Judge Sheindlin?
You want a cough drop?
I would say rather than stole, rescued.
I don't know. What is he asking me?
Don't drink it. Don't drink it.
Put it down.
What are you putting unfiltered
That's it. That's it. I'm done.
Mr David, while I understand that Mrs Shapiro did the wrong thing,
I can only say to you, sir, that anyone who would neglect a plant in that fashion doesn't deserve to have it.
Your case is dismissed.
We're done. There you go.
Parties are excused. You may step out.
This is crazy.
The beasts in the field?
And by beasts, I'm not talking
I'm talking about the oxen
Come on into bed, cowboy.
Yes, maam.
Forget it, forget it.
Hi. I'm bald, I wear glasses,
I'm very excited.
I'm right here. I'm sitting right next to you.
This is my friend, Joanna, from college.
I'm not a shucker.
I enjoy clams. I do.
I like oysters, but I don't shuck.
I know a shucker, but that doesn't mean that the shucker's gonna be here.
I'm here, not the shucker.
Do you like clams and oysters?
This is gonna be a big thing, though.
He can't wait to just get in there and start rewriting.
He shouldn't be getting into there, he should be getting into you, and I don't mean that in a sexual way.
I mean it in terms of time. into the weeds of the show.
Get into your weeds, again not sexual, but delve into you, you know.
Nonsexual delving is what I'm saying.
A nonsexual delve.
Ay, gosh.
Shoulder. Killing me.
How'd you hurt your shoulder?
Wrestling with Lin in his agent's office.
Yeah, yeah.
I've got pain pills.
God knows that I do not like this man
I do not like this
What a wonderful day of rehearsal, gang.
I like these men.
She's the best.
We're gonna start with the new choreography for Fatwa Sex.
Quick question for you. Cody wants to know which poster you like more.
I got one little, tiny note for you.
I noticed that you're denunciating with your fist.
Can we go over the choreo for
Fatwa Sex before we go onstage?
We'll have the dance captain come.
I can't believe how excited I am.
I've only been excited twice in my life.
You know, just sitting there, you can just feel how well that could work.
You know what we do?
Give them the bonus now.
Why have a bonus then?
It's not a bonus if it's already here.
Cody, what'd you think of that?
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
I gotta go to wardrobe and get changed.
Walk with me?
Great. Thanks, Cody.
But honestly, you should reconsider this.
Look, watch. Just watch this.
One second. I'm running, okay?
You're running.
And everybody's yelling from the windows.
That's your talk show bit.
You do that on Late Night and say,
It's gonna be great.
Hey, Cody, what'd you think of that?
Maybe like paintball?
Well, that's a great idea.
Lion King used to do that all the time.
Great, we'll do it this weekend.
You know, I'll pay for it.
What is it about it that's not working for you?
Do you agree?
They're coming in to see the first preview.
I was wondering if they could maybe stay with you.
Hotels are not their thing.
But aren't you renting a house?
Yeah, but me and V only have one bedroom.
There's really not room, and you've got that great big house.
Yeah, sure. What the hell.
All right. Thank you.
Wonder if there's anything else we need to do before tomorrow.
Yeah, no, no.
You've seen the choices.
What do we think?
Yeah, it's a little boxy.
Where's Funkhouser? Where is he?
I say next time, we tell him a half hour earlier.
David. Reservation.
Ah. Yes. Party of four.
Are you all here?
No, we have three.
We can't seat you until your entire party arrives.
We don't seat incomplete parties.
What's the point of the policy?
We have three people.
It's the same table.
What's the difference?
It makes for the optimal dining experience.
Okay, you know what the optimal dining experience is?
To eat when you're hungry, okay?
We do not sit incomplete parties.
I'm taking the cast and crew to do, like, a paintball day.
Yeah, we're gonna do it on Saturday.
It's Sammi's wedding this Saturday.
I thought it was the week after.
I sent you the invitation, you never fucking wrote it down?
You know what, I'll work it out.
I can do both.
You're making a speech.
You promised Sammi.
All right, I'll work it out.
I'll work it out.
No, but I'm hungry.
We don't have a reservation.
You can't get in anywhere.
It's crazy. You know how I get.
The blood sugar, up and down, up and down.
Okay, I'm gonna take care of this.
The food here is great and you know it.
I do.
Are you alone by any chance?
Okay, let's go.
We have four.
Okay.
Table six, please. if there's any profession that you can do later in life as a woman, it's acting.
Have we seen you in anything?
No, but I'm doing
Okay, she stands in for the star.
Right, yeah, I understand.
What are you doing out?
Aren't you kind of scared?
They called it off.
Yeah.
I've never done comedy, but it doesn't seem that hard.
All right, well, I'll put your card in my pocket.
I will never call you, but
I'll put it in my pocket.
And I'm very glad that that fatwa got cleared up. that maybe this fatwa thing is not as over as you think?
I recruited her from the bar.
We gotta get you a chair.
Where's the waiter?
Yeah. You know what?
You need to go now.
You stood in.
Now it's time to stand up.
But, hey, very good job.
And listen, Larry, if you ever need an actor, you call me, okay?
You never know.
Okay, I'm expecting the call.
Don't insult us with that.
If you're more than ten minutes late, it's gotta be a profuse apology.
That was an apology like you were one minute late.
Can I get a drink?
If I was 20 minutes late,
I'd be apologizing like I accidentally killed your family.
You did accidentally kill my family.
My nephew, the joy of my life, was killed by the bulls, and it was your fault.
I had a colonoscopy.
Clean as a whistle.
Good morning.
You're very welcome.
You are very, very welcome.
I have a gig booked.
Shooting a commercial for this feline distemper medication.
Mm, ah. What a shame.
How do you have an event like this without Cody Gutcher?
What are they paying you for this thing, may I ask?
It's my day rate. 1,200.
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna take care of that for you.
I'll give you the 1,200.
Tell them you can't make it.
You're going to paintball.
Thank you.
We couldn't do it without you, Cody Gutcher.
That was a thank you commensurate with the gesture.
And it's worth it for that thank you.
I love that thank you. Love it.
My pleasure.
There's too many redheads.
What do you think? Four?
Yeah, you're right.
I think four. Four is better.
What, are you tracking my outfits?
They're not dirty or anything.
Then by all means, wear them again.
You're an outfit tracker, Murray.
Nobody likes an outfit tracker.
I just feel like I'm living in some kind of clothing police state, like it's 1984.
Big Murray's watching me.
Big Murray's not watching you.
No, Big Murray is watching.
Big Murray has other things to do.
Apparently, Big Murray has nothing else to do but outfit track.
I'm not judging you,
I'm just noticing that you wore the same pants.
Okay, Big Murray.
I have great news. We got a signer.
Yeah, yeah, for deaf people.
And anyone who enjoys ASL.
I mean, she's basically on the side and she signs throughout the performance. one performance a month for all deaf people?
And we don't have to be distracted by a signer onstage.
You want to segregate the deaf?
No, I don't want to segregate them.
Yeah, separate, but equal.
Special, but equal.
She's gonna be incredible. You'll see.
It's really inclusive.
Do you like this robe?
That's what I thought.
We need to see more robes.
You're gonna have to go shopping again.
Thank you.
Okay, you're driving this poor guy nuts, okay?
No, he's gonna get in the weeds with us.
He's gonna emerge with the perfect robe.
Okay, well, I'm telling you, he's one foot out the door right now.
Well, as long as he's one foot out the door finding the right robe,
Hi, Ernst. Great to see you.
How are you?
Larry, this is my cousin
Valentina and her husband Ernst.
Tell me about this place.
I'm Gregory Michael David.
Yeah, just seems like fun to have people try on your creations.
Yes. If you wanna try anything on, please let me know.
Yes. Do you have things in turquoise?
He seems very competent.
Yeah. We're a robe away, but he's doing great.
I get it.
How long you two been married?
They've got the directions to your place.
Yeah, yeah, just go over anytime, make yourself at home, and stay as long as you like, actually.
All right. I see where you got your tepid thank yous from.
That was worse than your thank you.
That seemed like a perfectly appropriate thank you to me.
What is it with you Mirandas?
I think we all said it.
Yeah. Okay.
Hey, those are from a rental house, Lin.
Okay, everybody, we're at places, please, for Salman, Get Out.
Full tech and music
Come on up here, please.
We have a place for you.
That spike mark, downstage left.
Places for the top.
All right.
Good morning.
Hello, darling.
And breakfast for our guest.
No granola?
You should be grateful.
I'm grateful.
I'm just a little tired of muesli,
You wouldn't have made it on your own.
But now it's time for you to go.
I have to say I'm a little thrown.
And stay out.
Go stay with the ayatollah.
Okay, great.
Great work, everybody.
It was good. Too bad you missed it.
Hey, Larry, can I talk to you for a sec?
Cause everybody's looking at her tits, that's why.
What?
He was staring at her the whole time, as was every other guy in the audience.
No, I completely disagree with you.
Look, he's a terrible houseguest.
His life depends on his being a good houseguest.
He's a pig. He doesn't do the dishes.
That's funny.
Because men will look at tits over anything.
We're on the verge of making a great musical, and you're scapegoating tits?
Basically, you're paying this motherfucker to shoot people with a goddamn paint gun.
See?
You know what I just realized? but he wasn't gonna make 1,200.
They're gonna deduct taxes from what he's getting.
He'd only wind up with 700 or 750.
The guy just made $500 off me.
You fucked up.
You FICA. You take the fuckin' difference out.
He just made money on you.
Ah. Hello.
Ernest, Valentina.
Please, come in.
Yeah. Well, this is it.
He lives in my guesthouse.
My mother gave it to me.
It was hers.
They make that bag for men?
No, no, no.
It was during the intermission of Swan Lake.
I just looked to her and said,
Will you marry me?
Okay, that's a ballet, all right?
You got it?
Did you get on top of her on the honeymoon night?
Shut the fuck up. Get out of here.
I'm just asking questions.
Don't ask any more questions, okay?
Will you be joining us, Leon?
Yeah.
Cool.
Is that good?
Dining room, kitchen's that way.
By the way, make yourself at home.
You know, feel free to use the refrigerator.
You've got refrigerator privileges.
How's that?
Before I forget, this little gadget, okay?
Watch this.
You want the curtains down, you press that button, now you stop it, and now they go up.
Isn't that great? I love this thing.
Love it.
I don't see why I would ever need that.
No, no. Look, look. See?
Here, look.
Voila.
You're showing us the same function?
Whoo.
Why would we need two bedrooms?
No reason?
We are husband and wife.
We sleep in one bedroom.
No, but I know a lot of people who sleep in separate bedrooms.
Couples. Yeah.
You want names?
Dave Concepción.
Yeah.
Even the Hit King?
Yeah. Hit King especially.
Well, we sleep in a bedroom together.
Let's forget about it.
No good?
There wasn't really any emotion to it.
Yeah. Your eyes were bouncing around like a cat with strings.
Yeah.
You've just apologized for your apology?
Why don't you just use that apology?
Perfectly acceptable.
They're a couple of freaks, man.
Could you believe this kitchen?
Yeah.
It must have cost millions upon millions of dollars.
Well, it's big, but it's intimate.
We sit by the fire.
This is cozy?
This is the best party house.
Right, Jeff?
Yeah, yeah, I got the whole thing figured out.
I'm gonna go to paintball, then
I'm gonna go to the wedding.
I've known Sammi since she was born.
Are you serious?
Victor's parents are coming tonight, Lisa and Paul.
It's not fucking mold.
It's cheese.
Wait till you meet them.
They are just such sweet people.
It's wrong.
Yeah. Unbelievable how life works, isn't it?
Just to get laid. I'm an idiot.
Hey, I want to introduce my mom and my dad,
Lisa and Paul.
How do you do? Hello.
Hi. Larry. Larry.
Larry.
Rhymes with Harry.
How did you two meet?
Were you fixed up because you're deaf?
Ugh, stupid fucking question.
No, I'm not asking them that.
I'd be curious, too. I never asked it.
Ah. Bathroom? Around that way.
Yeah, there.
I'm hungry.
What? Again?
He's a guest. We're waiting for him to eat.
We're not gonna eat before
Funkhouser gets here.
Yeah, hold your horses.
That's a bad sign.
Hold your horses is,
Whoa, pull back.
Hold your horses.
Mine's better than yours.
This? No.
That's hold your horses.
Yeah. Thank you.
How about dog?
Yeah. Yeah.
Dog.
I have people I want you to meet.
Come with me. Enough of your nonsense.
Hey, did I tell you that Lin hired a signer for the show?
And she's got big, big boobs.
I can't wait.
Yeah, the interpreter. Yeah.
Not that big. Yeah.
I can't begin to apologize enough.
You don't have to say anything.
It's a fantastic apology.
One of the best apologies
I've ever heard.
I don't know what else to do.
What a fantastic fucking apology that was.
Thank you. I feel better.
All right, okay. Everybody's here.
Dinner.
Hello, darling.
Good morning.
What's this? What, are you tracking my outfits now?
Just an observation.
Yes.
Well, as long as we're talking about it, am I crazy, or have you worn them three days in a row?
Stop the tracking.
No one likes to be tracked.
Yes. How would you like it if we tracked you?
Do it. I'm in hiding with four outfits.
You'll never see me doubling up.
You know why? I rotate.
All you gotta do is rotate, baby.
What the hell is going on up there?
What is that?
What is that, incense?
Yeah, that's incense, brother.
It's like cooking fish or smoking a cigar. It's a violation.
Hi. Is Ernst here?
And Valentina.
Yeah. Yeah, really nice.
Thanks for your hospitality.
They're swinging. They're swinging.
You're a funny guy, man.
You got all this sexual shit going on,
I'm in the guesthouse chilling, you don't tell me about it?
Well, why'd you let it go on?
I thought you were in on it.
I didn't know.
Have you lost your mind?
You think I knew what was going on here?
I don't think I was sleepfuckin.
I have a hard enough time wakefuckin.
How am I gonna sleepfuck?
All right, look, I got paintball today.
We gotta get this place cleaned up.
I can't deal with this today.
Okay, I'll do it.
They ransacked the fridge and broke the goddamn Jacuzzi, too.
Last time I wore these pants,
F. Murray outfit tracked me.
I can't wear them around him anymore.
My favorite pants.
Just wear those.
Fine.
Josh, I love you. You're gonna get fuckin' shellacked if you're dancing out there.
We're out here playing paintball, man.
I go for the big dog.
I actually upgraded mine.
Are you guys getting bitten up?
You did it. You did this.
Maybe 750.
Am I wrong?
Now you're asking me for a portion of the gift back.
You're making a profit off this.
I'm gonna call you a prick.
With all due respect, you are the prick.
For accepting your gift?
It shouldn't be a gift, though.
I'm not giving you a gift.
I paid you the gross, and I should have paid you the net.
Why do you keep hiking your britches up?
I'm not giving you the money back.
Have fun today, Larry.
I'm not the bad guy here.
Larry, could I have a word with you, please?
If it isn't Big Murray. Hey.
You know what, Big Murray?
Cause of you, I couldn't wear my favorite gray corduroys, and now I'm wearing pants that are way too big for me.
Funny, huh?
Well, it was a little insulting to me.
It felt like it was a thin disguise for insulting me.
No. I would insult you right to your face, Big Murray.
That's what I would think, that you should insult me to my face, but the problem is, now I feel like
I'm being tracked because of what you did.
Big Larry's watching you.
Big Larry is not tracking Big Murray.
Big Larry is tracking Big Murray.
Big Larry has better things to do than track Big Murray.
Then why are you writing it all down?
Hey, Larry, can I talk to you a second?
Be careful what you say around this guy, huh?
He's a Murray tracker.
There's your outfit tracker, right there.
Hey, what's this I hear about you asking Cody Gutcher for his money back?
Yeah, I asked Cody Gutcher for my money back, yeah.
But not all of it.
Just the money he owed me.
Cody Gutcher is one of the best company managers in the fuckin' country.
We almost lost him to Spring
Awakening, and we have him.
I don't give a shit if Cody Gutcher goes to Spring Awakening.
I'm nice enough to give him $1,200, and he steals 450 of it.
You're nice enough to do the gesture.
Finish the gesture.
I did finish the gesture, then I was expecting a gesture from him.
No. Here's a gesture. Where's my gesture back, motherfucker?
That's your version of a gesture?
Are you happy?
Go for it.
Yeah, and I said, Thank you.
You know they're swingers, you don't tell me?
I told you they were an interesting couple.
Interesting is not swinging.
I was there when you met them.
You said, Make yourself at home.
Stay as long as you want.
This was like a Roman orgy, like Caligula.
You say please, you say thank you, you clean up.
May I use your refrigerator?
You should've seen.
They trashed the whole house.
And you know what else?
They broke my curtain remote.
It opens and closes, opens and closes the curtains.
Who needs a curtain remote?
You fuckin' do this.
That's how you open a curtain.
You've obviously never used a curtain remote.
Who would need one? It's a curtain.
It's a good thing. It's a fun thing.
If you ever did it, you wouldn't even think about it.
Well, I'm never coming to your house, cause I don't want to tiptoe around and maybe get refrigerator privileges.
You gesturerescinding motherfucker.
At least I don't have cousins who are sex degenerates.
Oh.
You've besmirched the honor of my family, and I demand satisfaction.
It's a duel.
I'm given to understand that one of the gentlemen has perceived a slight and demands satisfaction.
That's correct.
This is your final chance to offer an apology, thereby saving face.
No apology is forthcoming.
Very well. We shall proceed.
Gentlemen, choose your weapon.
Will anyone present stand as the second to the offended party?
I will.
Will anyone present stand forth as the second to the transgressor?
I will.
Swell.
If the principals would please hand their weapons to their seconds to be inspected and loaded with one projectile.
Why'd you volunteer for second if you don't know what you're doing?
I'm from Newport Beach.
I've never loaded a gun before.
Give me the paintball.
Gentlemen, on my count, you will proceed to walk ten paces, at which point you will turn, aim your weapons, and fire.
I was gonna fire in the air.
Aaron Burr.
Where the fuck is he?
He says he was gonna be here.
Victor and Sammi have asked you today to be here to bear witness and to offer your love and support as they embark on this next chapter of their lives.
Victor, we would be remiss if we didn't thank you for your service.
Now, please take each other's hands for your vows.
Victor, do you take
Sammi to be your wife?
I do.
Do you commit yourself to her happiness
All right, enough, enough.
Excuse me, miss.
It had to be done. We'll just continue.
I'm not Burr. I'm not Burr.
I was gonna fire in the air.
You shot right at me, Larry.
No, it's Murray's fault, because he was outfit tracking me and I had to put on a different pair of pants, and they were too big for me and they fell.
Do you wanna apologize for falling asleep during Hamilton?
Oh.
My wife told me you were practically on her shoulder.
Okay, what happened was,
I'm at fault for you sleeping through my show?
I did see part of the show.
I have to say, I loved it.
It was terrific.
I didn't see the end of the first act.
I have to see what they say, if they have tickets.
I don't run the ticket office, Larry David.
Make a phone call. What do you mean?
I gotta get to
Jeff's daughter's wedding.
Yes, yeah, I'm speaking there. Hey.
Can we make a quick stop?
It's just at that light.
It's about a half a mile and you go up the hill.
And you can drop me off.
It's two minutes.
No. This is not no fuckin' Uber.
We gotta get this man to the hospital.
He's injured.
It's gonna be a lot worse for me.
You don't know this woman.
Fuck that woman. And fuck her wedding.
Wait a second, Charlie.
Who are you calling, Larry?
You're trying to get laid on the way to the hospital?
Hey, Marie. It's Larry David.
Remember, I met you in the bar and you came and sat at the table with us?
Hey, I got a job for you.
Jeffrey, where's Larry?
He's still not here?
Well, start the speeches.
Get the fuck outta my face.
Jeff, can you call him again?
I'm not trying him again.
I called him, he didn't answer.
And don't worry, I have his speech.
Her name's Marie. Larry rents her.
And I just want to say how thrilled I am to be here today, and I am especially honored to have been asked to speak at this blessed event.
But I'm pretty sure I feel that way about everybody.
Sammi, I wish I had advice to offer you on how to have a successful marriage,
Thank you very much.
You need to be going right now.
Thank you.
Susie, can I, for my reel, get a copy of that?
I talked to Lin's doctors.
They said he'll be fine in about six months.
But he's moving on to other projects.
He's done. Fatwa. is over.
Our investments are gone.
I lost a ton, okay?
I told all these ladies I was
We lost a lot of money.
We are not selling that fuckin' house.
Didn't you wear that sweater yesterday?
What did you say?
What the fuck did you just say?
I'm not outfit tracking you.
I asked you a simple question.
I didn't work out in it. I wasn't on the subway. I didn't go in public toilets.
The sweater's clean. You can wear a sweater two days in a row.
It's not a shirt. I don't wear a shirt two days in a row.
You're an outfit tracker and I don't like it.
Thank you.
Hello?
Where's my food?
Aw. We'll start.
Mmm. This is fantastic.
Mmm.
Great.
I know who you are.
Yeah. You're Larry David.
You're a liar. You're a blasphemer.
No. No, it's true. They called it off.
No. No.
No. No.
Larry David, I am gonna kill you.
You happy with your color?
Fuckin' love my color.
Fuckin' mahogany. ‐Yeah. You're mahogany. ‐Yeah.
What is it?
Black people, your skin tone's like, it depends on the amount of milk you put in the coffee.
Fuckin' right.
I'm like a fuckin' Yoo‐hoo. ‐I shake that motherfucker up.
I'm shakin' it up. ‐Yoo‐hoo's a good color. ‐Fuckin' good color. Shit. ‐Yeah, Yoo‐hoo's a really good color. ‐Yeah. ‐What?
Hey. Larry. ‐Randi. Yeah. ‐You got it. ‐I'm a friend of Susie's. ‐I know, I know, I know.
Yeah.
Happy New Year.
Eh.
It's a little late, frankly, for the Happy New Years, you know?
Why? It just happened a couple of weeks ago, right?
Yeah, that's too long.
The statute of limitations has kind of run out on the New Years. ‐Three days. Plenty. ‐Three days?
By the way, everything doesn't have to be happy.
Why does everything have to be happy? ‐I'm having a pretty good day. ‐Yeah. Look at you. ‐That's, that's huge. ‐Yeah, I'm about eight months.
I'm your guy. ‐Yeah. ‐What would you suggest?
Swedish, perhaps?
I don't know, gel.
You like saying that, don't you. ‐Do I like saying that he's African‐American? ‐Yeah.
I think you wanted me to know.
Does it change your opinion of me?
Enjoy your workout.
What are you doing?
What?
What's with the‐‐
What's with the jogging?
You, you're jostling the fetus.
You can't‐‐
I was advised by my midwife that I should continue to work out.
Maybe you want to consult your blacksmith.
I can't watch this. ‐Happy New Year. ‐Yeah, Happy New Year. ‐Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, man. ‐You gotta stay dry. ‐You're over‐talcing here. ‐Ugh. ‐Happy New Year.
Yeah, yeah. ‐I couldn't even breathe in there. ‐Right.
It was disgusting. ‐I mean, who still uses that? ‐I use that shit all the time. ‐Can't be good for you. ‐Not if you're allergic to it.
Took her to the ER. ‐Man, they had to pump her stomach for nothing. ‐That's incredible.
Know what I noticed?
No one ever wears those hats on backwards.
If mean, if you're gonna get your ass kicked, you want to see it coming. ‐I like that. ‐Yeah. ‐Mocha‐‐ Mocha Joe's
Mocha Joe.
I appreciate it. ‐Thank you.
What are you doin' here? ‐Hey. ‐What's your name? ‐Leon. ‐Leon. Nice to meet you. ‐This is unreal.
Do you believe it? Huh?
What can I get you guys?
I'll get a‐‐
Do you have scones?
Yeah. Right there.
They're beautiful.
What about you, Leon? ‐Let me get a latte.
All right. One scone, a coffee, a latte.
There you go.
Appreciate it. and a coffee, please.
Thank you.
Mm.
What, the scone?
Yeah. Scones are supposed to be hard.
This is like a muffin.
Well, not really.
It's supposed to be fresh.
Yeah, fresh hard.
Well, that's a fresh scone.
I'm not quite sure you know what a scone is,
I don't think it's really open to interpretation, though.
You want the scone, or not?
Yeah? ‐Check out this table. ‐Yeah?
You got a wobbly table, here.
Yeah, well, stop moving it.
Stop moving it? It's‐‐
Every time I, I, I lean on it, ‐it's gonna move. ‐Put your foot on it, like everybody else does.
I'm gonna sit with my foot on the table?
Yeah, that's how you hold it down.
The floors are wobbly. ‐Mocha Joe, can I give you a little advice? ‐Yeah.
Nobody likes a wobbly table.
Fastest way to lose customers is wobbly tables.
I got an uncle with a wobbly leg.
I can't stand that motherfucker.
Leaning on shit all the time. ‐Hmm.
Taste your coffee. ‐Cold. ‐It's cold.
Hey, man. ‐Yeah. ‐What?
This is cold coffee.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.
That coffee is not cold. ‐Is your coffee cold? ‐Your coffee's hot, right?
Look, we don't wanna be fuckin' haters right now, but this shit is cold.
Cause that's a hot cup of coffee. ‐It was hot when
I gave it to you‐‐ ‐That's a hot cup of coffee?
It's a hot cup of coffee.
It was hot when
I gave it to you.
Would you stick your nose in a hot cup of coffee?
Why would you stick your nose‐‐
Because I want to prove to you that it's cold coffee.
Watch this.
You think I want to sit here with a wobbly table, ‐and drink cold black coffee? ‐Yeah. ‐No, thank you. ‐Yeah, good. Get out.
Hey. Larry might be one or two of those things, but not all three.
Happy New Year, Larry.
Happy New Year, Mocha Joe.
Morning, Larry.
How are you? ‐Your dog? ‐Bogey.
I thought it was an office bowl.
Not for dogs.
It needs to be sterilized.
All right, what‐‐
What the hell is that?
Why is one eye closed?
I don't‐‐
I don't share it with everybody.
If I walked in here with a horn on my head, would you say,
What are you doing with a horn on your head?
It's a reminder of that to me. ‐It's just for me. ‐Really?
Then why didn't you put it on your ass?
There's an initial, and a date, and I think three signatures.
That's my shirt.
You can't clean your glasses with a shirt that I'm wearing while I'm wearing it.
It's inappropriate.
It's crossing a boundary. ‐No good? ‐No good.
Okay.
I know. Susie loves this house even more than her last one.
Well, the last one stunk.
It was too big.
He called me old and bald. ‐What? ‐I swear to God.
You know,
I love coffee, and I love his coffee, but you're one of my old‐‐
You are my oldest friend.
I'm gonna boycott that place. ‐You're gonna boycott
Mocha Joe's? ‐I'm boycotting. ‐Hey. ‐I'm boycotting Mocha Joe.
You can't do that to my friend. ‐Look at this guy.
Look at this guy. ‐That's a friend.
Enjoy your coffee. ‐He's boycotting. ‐He's boycotting.
Who invited you?
You pig.
He looks like Harvey Weinstein.
He looks just like him. ‐What the hell? ‐Okay.
All the time, women, men‐‐ doesn't matter. ‐And suddenly, I'm this guy. ‐Unbelievable. ‐Unbelievable.
I've been following her around all night, but she never has any.
They go fast.
I don't care how foo‐foo the other items are, ‐and people love 'em, pigs in a blanket. ‐Yeah.
Larry, I am extremely displeased with your behavior.
Let's give him a big round of applause. ‐Like you know anything about fashion. ‐It is such an honor to be standing near you,
Mr President.
This hat is very similar to the one that
How about that? ‐Yeah. Yeah, fine.
You act ridiculous.
Why are you harassing my friend Randi at the gym?
You don't know anything about fetuses.
I know you don't go on a treadmill eight months pregnant.
You don't have to be a genius ‐to figure that out. ‐Why not? Why not?
Do you think that's good for fetus?
All that jostling?
It's not your job to mansplain to Randi. ‐Jeff, there's people
I want you to meet. ‐Okay.
You're too late.
Happy New Year.
Come on. It's three weeks. ‐Isn't it almost a month already? ‐It's ridiculous.
Aw, I missed 'em again.
It's unbelievable.
Hey, Larry.
Hey. ‐Hey. ‐How you been? ‐Good. ‐Yeah, great to see you.
Shit. That's Rosen‐‐ ‐Phil Rosenthal. ‐Phil Rosenthal.
He just talks about his shows all the time.
His own show, and how about‐‐
He should be feeding other people.
It should be called
Phil Feeds Everybody. ‐You know what I'm gonna do with him tonight? ‐What's that?
The Big Goodbye.
I'm employing
The Big Goodbye. ‐It's the greatest move in history. ‐How great is The Big Goodbye?
And then at the end, when you're about to leave, you go, Ah.
Susie wants to see it. ‐Yeah, I'll do it. ‐You will? ‐Yeah.
Okay, good.
Because I want Ted to see it before he leaves. ‐Of course. ‐Thank you.
Ted. ‐I'd like to thank
Jeff and Susie ‐for inviting us into their beautiful home. ‐I like the other one.
Well, I think the house is very nice.
Did they throw that fish smell in for free?
He sure thinks so. ‐Oh.
And how about Susie, our inimitable hostess? ‐Susie, I love the curtains, but why did you make a jacket out of it? ‐Are you having a good time? ‐A good time?
Are you kidding me?
I'm with a bunch of stiffs, the food sucks, the drinks aren't strong enough, and your hand is up my ass.
Aw. That's the end.
Bravo. Cheryl and Larry. ‐Cheryl and Larry.
What a great audience.
Thank you. Thank you. ‐Fantastic.
Actually, you know what,
I better not.
I don't wanna catch a cold.
You don't need to call her when you land.
If there's a plane crash, we'll know about it. ‐Okay. I'll walk you, Ted. ‐Thank you, guys.
Ah. There you are.
Finally gotcha.
Sir, I need you to get out of here.
Get out of here?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I mean, it's a been a while, but we've still got it. ‐What are‐‐
What are you doing? ‐I'm gonna go home. ‐I'm just getting an Uber. ‐Uber? ‐I'll take you home. ‐You don't have to do that.
Ah, it's nothing. ‐Okay. Okay.
Give me two minutes.
Okay. All right. Thanks.
Are you kidding?
I can't believe
I didn't get a chance to talk to you all night, and now I'm on my way out. ‐What a shame. ‐You giving me
The Big Goodbye? ‐The Big Goodbye? What are you‐‐
What are you talking about? ‐Big Goodbye.
Where you avoid me all night, and then you think you can cure it by having a Big Goodbye.
I know. I've been around. ‐I wasn't giving you a Big‐‐ I never heard of the Big Goodbye. ‐It seems like a Big Goodbye.
No, it wasn't.
It was just a normal goodbye. ‐That's a normal goodbye. ‐Yeah? ‐Yeah. ‐Really?
Yeah. I wasn't trying to avoid you.
Are you kidding?
Why would I avoid you?
Have lunch with me
Wednesday?
We have a lot to talk about.
Listen, we're doing Raymond in Portugal.
Yeah.
Everybody Loves Joam.
It's fantastic.
I get to go.
I want you to do my show.
I want to go to Ethiopia with you. ‐Ethiopia's great.
I don't think I'm running off to Ethiopia‐‐
Sure, you eat with your hands.
It's fantastic. ‐Everybody shares, and, and the thing‐‐ ‐I don't like to leave the continent, you know. ‐No? ‐Nah. ‐All right.
You know what?
We'll start lunch Wednesday.
We'll see where it goes.
You said goodbye and then you didn't leave? ‐I did a Big Goodbye and then I didn't‐‐ ‐Come on. ‐And I didn't leave. ‐And what did they do?
They were mad? ‐I ran into her in the kitchen about an hour later. ‐Come on.
And what do you say?
What do you even say?
She said,
I thought you left.
I said, Well, you know.
I don't know.
I made up a story.
I, but I,
Well, I can't believe that you kissed me when you knew I had a cold.
That was pretty unbelievable.
I would do it again.
Wow, Larry.
What are we doing?
By the way, before we get into that, are you aware that you have a wobbly table here?
Look at this.
Look at this table.
It's unbelievable. ‐I, I don't know how you can go to bed at night. ‐Yeah, it doesn't bother me.
If all tables in your house wobbled, you could live like that?
You could in a wobble‐house?
We need to talk about Ted.
I'm, I'm your ex‐husband.
Ted is such a good person.
You don't do that.
You don't date a friend's ex‐wife.
I'm better than you. ‐You're better than me.
I can relate to what you're saying, cause I don't, I don't feel that way with people. ‐I feel morally inferior to people. ‐Yeah.
I can crush them.
You know, and, and they eat each other.
We'll see.
Ha‐ha. ‐What? ‐Where the fuck you been at? ‐What are you? My mother? ‐Fuck yeah, I am.
All right,
I was at a party, okay?
I was at Jeff's party. ‐That party was over a long time ago. ‐Huh?
Yeah. This right here‐‐
This right here?
It's called tappin' hours.
This is the hours when people are tappin' ass.
I'm not tappin.
I'm not tappin.
Older white men should not be out this fuckin' late.
There's no late‐night yacht club, or late‐night garage sales and shit like that.
You out here fuckin.
When I'm tappin',
I always tell you.
I come home and spread the fuckin' news.
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?
You wanna know who I'm tappin'? ‐Who the fuck you tappin'?
It's Phil Rosenthal.
He's just‐‐
What do you do?
How many times can you say no?
You couldn't do the Big Goodbye?
I did the Big Goodbye.
He saw right through it.
Ah. You know what I'll do?
I'll call you in the middle of lunch.
Say it's an emergency and you gotta go.
I did that the last time
That guy's relentless.
Yep.
Dropped her off.
Said good night.
Went on my merry way.
You know, can I person not just ask ‐a, a normal question? ‐No, they're not normal questions. ‐There's a lot of implications.
A lot of implications.
You're on a little fishing expedition.
You know what?
Don't eat all the leftovers.
Hey. Did you sleep with Cheryl? ‐Yeah. ‐You did? ‐Yeah. Listen. ‐Ah.
You cannot say anything to Susie. Cannot.
Cheryl swore me to secrecy.
She didn't want me to tell you.
But I had to.
I couldn't‐‐
How could I not?
Yes. Wha‐‐
What are you hoping to get out of it, though?
We on for golf on Saturday?
Arnie Norton asked if he could play.
I'm not playing with him.
See him around town with that hat.
Make America Great Again.
I don't need that crap.
He just‐‐
He makes me want to not be anywhere near him.
I don't know.
You can check with Carl.
See if he wants to play.
I gotta go.
Hi. I'm Phil Rosenthal.
Mr David's already here. ‐He is? Wow. ‐Yes. Right this way. ‐Very impressive. ‐He was early.
Enjoy.
Hey, Phil.
Good to see you.
Sit. Sit down. Sit down.
It was such a good idea.
You, you were definitely right.
I'm, I'm starving.
I hope this place is good.
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
It's big portions on the food and everything.
You know what else?
Really thinking about this Ethiopia thing.
Yeah, actually,
Wasn't that one of the shithole countries?
He needs to see me because he has a little anxiety.
No, no. You know what?
No, no.
Ah.
Fill her up. ‐Ah. Arigato. ‐Yes. ‐Arigato. ‐All right. Two seats at the sushi bar.
You know what?
Actually, I think we'd prefer to sit at a table, please.
Huh.
Sad.
What the fuck?
What are you trying to do, man? ‐What the fuck are you doing?
Will do. Will do.
Okay. Thank you. and my Danish ‐What are you‐‐
What are you doing here?
What do you mean what am I doin' here? ‐Come here. Come out.
I want to talk to you. ‐You come here. ‐No, come on.
Come on out here. ‐No, you come. ‐Come on. I want to talk to you. Come on. ‐I'm not leaving. You come. ‐You come. You come.
What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna boycott this place.
Sitting here drinking coffee?
That's a boy‐‐
That's quite a boycott.
I told you, for the rest of my dying days,
I will never come to this place with you. ‐Ever. ‐That's not what you said. ‐I said I was‐‐ ‐You said you're boycotting this place.
And you're never coming back here.
You didn't say with me.
What are you?
My Jewish puppet master?
I can do whatever the fuck I want alone, ‐but with you,
I will never come in here. ‐Look.
I swear on my life.
Who the fuck needs you for a boycott if I'm boycotting already?
I don't need you to boycott.
You said you're boycotting, ‐but you didn't boycott. ‐Are you done?
Now she's drinking coffee. ‐Susie's friend. I saw her in the gym the other day.
She's eight months pregnant.
She was running on a treadmill.
She has no regard for this fetus.
Now she's drinking coffee.
This coffee, by the way, is unbelievable.
It's fantastic. ‐Is it hot? ‐It's very hot. ‐Let me see that for a second. ‐Hey, don't touch my‐‐
I don't like‐‐ Don't touch it.
What the‐‐ Hey, stop it.
What are you, a fuckin' goose?
Okay. That's not hot coffee, okay?
If that was hot coffee,
I, I would have burned my nose.
Who asked for a nose test?
I didn't want a nose test. ‐What, are you outta your mind? ‐Not hot.
What the hell is going on here? ‐Is he bothering you,
You know what, Larry?
Get out. ‐Huh. ‐This is what it's come to.
You're banned. For life.
I never wanna see you in here again. ‐Is that so? ‐Yeah. You're banned.
Banned. Get out.
With pleasure.
Mark my words, Mocha Joe, and mark them well.
I don't know how, and I don't know when, but I will exact vengeance.
As God is my witness,
I will bring you to the brink of extinction, or I will die trying. ‐Happy New Year, Mocha Joe. ‐Happy New Year, Larry.
Hey, Happy New Year, man.
Happy New Year.
Hello, Larry David's office.
Hi, my name is Valerie Ashburn.
I'd like to speak to Larry David.
Yes, may I ask what this is regarding?
What‐‐
What happened?
I was catering at a party.
Larry was molesting me with his eyes the entire night.
And then when I went into a pantry, he followed me in, cornered me, and he grabbed my breast.
Everything was fine.
I have on my arm, and I wouldn't tell him what it meant, and then he got obsessive about it.
What the fuck.
Fuck.
Shit.
Damn it. Frickin' dog.
And he grabbed my shirt to wipe his glasses.
Hold on.
I have to shut the door. ‐Larry? in a second.
Okay. ‐What's with the robe?
What, what are you doing here?
You haven't been here in a year.
What the fuck is going on with you? ‐What are you talking about? ‐You're wearing a MAGA hat at a sushi restaurant? ‐Is that true? ‐Well, I did have the hat on, yeah. ‐What, are you pro‐Trump? ‐No, no.
And it worked like a charm.
He saw me in the hat and he left the restaurant. ‐It was amazing. ‐I'm not surprised.
You know what?
It's really comin' in handy.
Yeah, 'cause no one's gonna wanna be anywhere near you.
Exactly.
It's, it's a great people repellent. ‐You know, look.
When you're a celebrity, you can do anything you want.
You can grab 'em by the pussy‐‐ ‐What did you say? ‐What?
You're friends with that monster? ‐No, I'm‐‐ ‐No, no, no, no, no. ‐No. No, no, I'm just‐‐
I'm getting a lawyer.
No. What? Hey. What?
No. I'm in the bathrobe cause your fuckin' dog got hair all over my cereal bowl, and that's not Weinstein. ‐I'll take it. ‐It's all yours.
What are you doin' here, Larry?
I thought I told you to get out and not come back.
I've merely come to inform you that I have leased the place next door, where I'll be opening up a coffee shop exactly the same as yours.
Only charging much lower prices.
All for the express purpose of taking you down.
Knock yourself out.
I welcome the competition. ‐Yeah. ‐I'm not afraid of you.
You don't have the beans.
See ya, Larry. ‐You know what
I'm gonna call it? ‐What?
Latte Larry's.
Can I come in?
Y‐yes. ‐Yes, yes. ‐Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Give me two minutes.
Two minutes.
I'll be right back.
Stay right there. ‐Fuckin' my movie up.
Fuck.
Who you tappin'?
Cheryl.
What? My man Larry David re‐tappin' that ass.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Did she ingest anything else?
Are you kidding?
I couldn't even look at you before.
I could barely glance at you.
Yeah. But you know,
What do you mean what would you have done?
Well, I mean, could I have lived with you looking like that? ‐You're such an asshole.
Susie?
What are you guys doing here?
What are you‐‐
What are you doing here?
Okay.
I knew it.
I could smell it.
That night at our house.
The ventriloquist.
I knew it. I knew it.
You‐‐ You can't be here.
You better leave.
You better leave, Larry.
How does he‐‐
How does he know you're in the hospital?
Because he's her significant other, and you're her significant nothing. ‐Just keep your fuckin' trap shut.
Oh. ‐Hey. ‐Excuse me, sir. ‐God. ‐Larry. ‐You?
Are you fucking kidding me, you piece of shit?
After what that fetus has been through, this'll be a day at the beach.
Happy New Year.
It's a coffee place.
I'm opening up a spite store to take him out of business.
I don't know what a spite store is and I don't really care.
Can I give you a little tip?
It's hard to take a person seriously wearing shorts.
I wanna give you a heads up.
Susie's birthday's in about a week.
It's gonna be a nice surprise.
What is it?
What were you thinking?
I'm done with presents.
The first contention is you yanked at her clothes.
I cleaned my glasses.
I can handle this.
If she gets anything at all here, it would be a travesty.
And I would,
I would leave the country.
I don't know where I'd go, but I would leave.
I hear Canada is a good place, maybe.
I want to assure you that as upsetting as this is,
A settlement?
Millions for defense.
Not one cent for tribute.
That's what we said when the British were impressing our seamen.
You, you know they tried to impress our seamen, right?
They'd be on the ship, they'd yell across at one of our ships.
Hey, there. We have the best dental plan in all of Europe.
Why, look at our bicorn hats and fancy brass buttons.
How's that, sailors?
Are you impressed by that?
Anything else we haven't gone over?
If I do happen to call you, which I very well could, does that mean that
I'll be charged for the time?
Right there at reception where you came in, there's a little jog in the hallway.
Yeah. No. I already saw that, but
You'll be much happier down the hall.
We just redid 'em. They're great.
I'll leave it exactly the way I found it.
I'm like a murderer going in there.
I completely expunge all evidence that I was ever there.
Motion denied, as they say in the profession.
Where is it?
Down the hall and to the right.
Hi.
Is that a problem?
Well, I mean, to be perfectly honest, do you really think that you need it?
It's not about the money, okay?
It's about having to go into your pants pocket, in a car when you're paying.
Have you ever been in a car trying to get to your pocket?
This is why homeless people don't make a lot of money from people in cars, 'cause nobody wants to go into their pockets.
There you are, Mr David.
You have a lovely day.
This is only for an hour.
I was here for
Sure thing.
Here, Mr David.
You have a good day.
Hope to see you again. I intend to be in this building a lot.
That's fantastic.
Hello?
I would like to get an MRI just to be safe.
Is there a mass?
Yes. There is a mass.
Well, that we don't know, and that's why
Just contact my office, and, uh, we should get the results in two days.
Possible flush, no straight.
Ooh.
All right, I'm in.
Why weren't you at the fundraiser the other night?
I sent you the invitation.
Why weren't you there?
Never got it.
Must have got lost in the mail.
Aah, boy. I don't trust the mail anymore.
I swear I don't.
That stinks.
I would have gone to that.
All right, next card is a ten of spades.
You're out. You check.
I wanna give you a heads up.
Susie's birthday is in about a week.
As a matter of fact, she wants a camera.
She's shameless, this woman.
She's shameless.
You don't get to pick your gift, okay?
It's gonna be a nice surprise.
All right, nine is the last card.
You got the bet.
Go ahead. You guys are out.
Go ahead.
I just want you to know before you bet, I have a pair of aces.
Okay.
Twenty bucks, aces.
I have a pair of aces.
I call. What do you have?
Okay. I got three nines.
On the river, you get a nine.
Cincinnati Kid.
You are the luckiest guy around.
You're up.
I can't do the cancer friend.
You know, I gotta agree with Jeff.
If you get cancer,
I'll never speak to you again.
When I found out my daddy had cancer,
I never spoke to that man again.
I don't know.
That's fuckin' deep, man.
All right, I'll tell you what.
I have a proposal.
Let's make a little deal here, okay? reciprocity pact.
If anyone gets it, we all stop being friends with you, and vice versa.
How are you feeling?
I'm better. that talc incident.
I, I don't understand it.
They're all over.
It's an epidemic.
I'm gonna end the wobbly table epidemic, in my coffee house.
Ah. You know what?
I think I'll do a little, uh,
I don't think that's a good idea.
It feels a little close.
Oh.
It's my mailman.
His name's Lionel.
Hey.
I mean, how do you feel about it?
Well, I feel the same as I've always felt.
I think we should be together.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I think we should be apart.
It's just a test, right?
I mean, a lot of people get tested.
Not for cancer.
No, this is cancer.
Well, I hope your tests come back negative, but we're not gonna get back together.
Would that alter your thinking about us at all?
I think you'd have a pretty good time.
But I can get a nurse and complain to the nurse and leave you out of that part.
You know, we could do a lot of traveling.
You don't like to travel.
Would you mind if
I brought the nurse along?
Okay. I think we're good the way we are.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Mr Greene.
How ya doing?
A birthday present.
Not gonna happen. but what are, you know, what are you gonna do?
I'll tell you what you do.
You're gonna get back out there.
You can't date now.
How do you even make a move in this climate?
And I'm old and bald.
You can, you can paint them blue, and wear an Abe Lincoln hat.
You'll be fine.
Okay. I'm gonna get back out there.
The other night at poker, that invitation, it, it didn't get lost.
Blame it on the mailman.
What? What? What?
I did this year.
Yeah, what is it?
It's magnificent.
It's a work of art.
It's not just 'cause it's me.
All is forgiven.
Everything you've ever done, every horrible thing you've done to me is forgiven for this.
What are you talking about?
Screwing up my deck.
Hey, Milos. Milos.
What were you thinking?
I thought I told you a camera, a fucking camera.
What? It's shit.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not paying for this piece of shit crap.
You redo it, or you don't get paid.
It's bullshit.
I've heard that you're going around telling people that I've lost their invitations? get that from?
Andy and Cassie David told me.
Can I tell you a little story?
I never got the invitation.
I've never lost a piece of mail. go tell Andy and Cassie the truth about this.
I'll consider it. Look, can
I give you a little tip?
This is the required uniform for a postman.
What does that have to do with this?
They give you five or six pairs, and you rotate them. Okay?
It's hard to take a person seriously wearing shorts.
I'm at work, doing work.
This is my work uniform.
Excuse me one second.
I was giving you a good tip.
Hello?
It's Dr. Bahn.
The test results came back.
As you know, we did on the mass.
It's just a benign cyst, not cancerous.
Ah. Negative. Negative.
Yes.
Mr Swindell will be here in five minutes.
All right.
All's good?
You've been well?
Funny you should mention it, cause I had a bit of a scare at the doctor,
You must be relieved.
Well, I'm relieved, except it's been two days since I found out, and not one of my friends has inquired as to how the test turned out, not one.
I am really relieved that you got the news that you got.
Which is that Ms. Huff's team gave me a call, and she would like to meet with you. just the two of you alone in a public place, of course.
Alice wants to meet?
The fact that she is reaching out is great.
That's fantastic.
Maybe she's come to her senses.
Then the whole thing could go away.
That's good news. Look at you.
Hold on one second.
Just to get a tissue.
What's up?
Problem?
Did you use my bathroom?
What? No.
Why would I use your bathroom?
You told me not to.
I mean, you did ask to use it.
Yes, I did, but you were quite emphatic about it.
I'm telling you the truth.
I guess.
It would take me about a day, maybe less, maybe a half an hour.
And I would never look out the window again and go,
Why fly public when you can fly private, am I right?
I mean, the public toilets, forget it.
Have you been in a woman's restroom?
Do you know how vile women can be?
You guys get to stand up.
We have to sit down.
Hey, you know what? I'll take you out for a night on the town.
We'll, we'll look at men's rooms and ladies' rooms, and we'll make a little comparison.
Would you like to do that?
Please, God.
Please make that happen.
I'm game.
I, I, I don't even know what to say. I'm shocked.
My name is Rita.
Rita. You'll be hearing from me.
You lucky gal.
What? What?
I'm opening up a spite store to take him out of business.
You're making too much
I've never seen you
If you ever see me sitting,
Hello?
What were you thinkin gettin' Susie that painting?
It stares at me.
It's just there.
I go for a snack, it's staring at me.
I could do.
Well, I told you to get her a camera.
Why couldn't you get her a camera?
I should have given her the camera.
Next time get her a camera.
Believe me, there won't be a next time.
Good. Don't get her anything again.
I will never give anyone a gift again.
What do you think about that?
I think it's the best idea you've had all day.
Aah.
I like what you did with this apartment.
Thank you.
I borrowed it.
You don't play, and you borrowed a piano?
It was a joke.
I didn't borrow the piano.
That's quite an attempt at a joke.
Thank you.
You could use it.
That's okay.
I would like to ask you a series of questions to determine how comfortable you are with physical contact as it progresses.
All right.
That is acceptable.
Ah. By the way, throughout this process,
I would encourage any feedback.
How would you feel about a little grazing of the lips?
I think I would feel very good about that.
Well, then a grazing you shall have.
Aha.
Hmm.
Well, now I think we have to take a little break.
With your permission, of course,
You know, just in case there are any discrepancies
I will forward it to you and cc, or bcc to anyone you like.
Fantastic.
That is correct.
Nobody forced me.
Nothing's happened without your permission.
Okay.
I'm placing my right hand back on her right shoulder, with her permission, of course.
And now, what I'd like to do is take this left hand, which I've introduced to you earlier,
I'm going to place it on your inner thigh, and slowly inch my way up,
Well, seeing as it is our first date, Larry,
I think that I'm going to have to say no to that.
I'm gonna have to say no again.
Okay. Another no.
Hand's away. Look at the hand.
All gone.
Well.
End session.
This is quite an addition.
Isn't it?
You know, if I tell you who got that for me, you're gonna be shocked.
Larry David, the most thoughtful man
I've ever met, had that commissioned.
Where do you find an artist like that?
You'll find it.
You look it up.
Anything smaller would have felt too small.
Bigger would have felt ostentatious.
It's not even that, Susie.
Know what it is? I've never seen you with, I don't know, with such a joy for life in that painting.
Did you have to send him a picture and then he painted it from that?
Yeah.
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.
Three days now. I've gotten the results back from my cancer test.
Not one of you bothered to call me and ask me if I got the results back.
Not one.
And by the way, I did, and I'm fine. Okay?
We were, we're very immersed in it. been working with her nonstop.
And I, I, I honestly planned on it, but I, I,
I planned on it.
I ain't gonna lie, man.
I fuckin' forgot.
What kind of friends are you?
Seriously. What kind of friends are you?
You know what?
Holy Christ.
You ruined my painting.
You destroyed it.
Jeff?
Where the fuck do you get off?
This was the prized possession of this household.
I'm gonna replace that painting.
I'm gonna give it to the artist, he's gonna fix it, it's gonna be better than ever.
You don't bring it back until it's perfect.
We were at LACMA, and we met this guy who restores paintings.
Larry, we're gonna help out.
Don't you worry.
Hey. Shut the fuck up.
I told you I'm gonna do it.
Okay. Okay.
God.
You know what?
I think this whole thing can be a blessing in disguise.
I've never been entirely happy with this painting.
He didn't really capture the luster of your skin.
Or, or the sparkle in your eyes.
The sparkle in her eyes.
Now I realize it.
A blessing in disguise.
It's incredible.
Plus, I have extra boards for you.
I take it to your house and fix your pantry like new. to your house right now.
Ha.
Mrs Greene.
No friend of the working man.
Okay. Larry, listen,
I mean, the whole thing was just a series of unfortunate misunderstandings.
That wasn't Harvey Weinstein.
That was Jeff Greene, my manager.
You don't get to demand to know what it's about, because it's on my body.
I'm not that guy.
Come back to work.
Bring Bogey. I miss Bogey.
You know, this is how culture moves forward.
No, no. Wait. Where are you going?
Stay here just one second.
Hmm?
All right.
You're all right.
No, Alice.
How'd those test results turn out?
Thank you very much.
What do you think?
We give 'em a down payment.
Is that too generous?
You know, I never know.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
What the fuck?
It was beautiful, and it's all destroyed.
You piece of shit, Larry.
You piece of fucking turd nothing. Fuck you.
Asshole.
Mr David.
Did you ask Ms. Huff inappropriate questions about her relationship with her dog, Bogey?
When she asked you to stop asking questions about her tattoo, did you respect her wishes?
I was very curious about it.
There's a guy with one eye.
I thought it might have been
Mr Clean.
Do you have any idea?
I have no further questions for the witness.
Okay. I actually just have a couple, Lucy.
Mr David, the answers you're giving today are your sworn testimony, isn't that right? voluntarily?
Because you want the truth to be known.
And I remind you, you're under oath.
Did you or did you not use my bathroom?
Okay. I'm worried you're not taking this seriously.
You're blithely eating an apple here.
There's no other way to eat an apple but blithely.
How do you serve eggs without toast?
You can't serve the eggs without the toast.
You are like a president in the 18th century on the back of a train saying,
And there will always be toast with eggs.
A guy who speaks six languages.
You wanna impress people with lies?
Well,
Hello ? Mr Porter ?
Are you Chulu Porter ?
It's been a while. A long time ago.
What a hotel. I mean, there were a couple of problems
I have to say.
I like a cold room, Chulu.
And the tub was too small.
But besides that, what I loved about it was every morning I'd go downstairs to the restaurant, and I'd have a cup of coffee and a scone.
And those scones were the best scones
I need you to make me those scones.
See, Chulu, the thing is, there's this man.
He's got this coffee place.
He's kicked me out of it.
He's banned me from it.
And I opened up a place next door to his.
I've sworn revenge and with your help, maybe I can get it.
Well, what's this guy's name, anyway ?
Did you say Mocha Joe ?
Well, what you think ?
Pretty good .
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.
Larry, I think we're beyond the details of what happened at this point, because her attitude has completely changed.
Alice and her attorneys are out for blood, and I think the priority now is keeping this from going public.
You know, you have Seinfeld syndication, you have a Hulu deal.
You don't want headlines about you being sued for sexual harassment by a former assistant.
Can't believe what it did to me.
I think unfortunately we're in a
But, in your case I think it's eminently worth it for the value to you of having this thing over with and not lying around to be discovered by the public.
What ? Get the fuck out of here .
Are you kidding ?
That money is not for her. It's for a charity called Survivors United, devoted to victims of sexual harassment, Alice's charity of choice.
I know. My, my cousin Andy's wife is involved with that. Cassie, yeah.
That's great because, in addition to the financial remuneration, they would like you to make a speech.
They want me to make a speech ?
What am I supposed to say ?
I think she wants you to, in a public way, show contrition and show that this has moved you a step forward, that you've evolved as the result of this experience.
I'm gonna call Alice's attorneys immediately to let her know that you're on board with this.
What are you doing ?
I think I'm eating an apple.
Okay. I'm worried you're not taking this seriously.
You're blithely eating an apple here.
There's no other way to eat an apple but blithely.
You're incorrect about that.
My dad ate angry apples all the time.
An angry apple ?
He communicated a tremendous amount of hostility.
You cannot eat an apple angry.
It's impossible.
I think there are a lot of emotional colors available when eating an apple, not just blitheness.
I completely disagree with you.
I'm concerned you're not taking this seriously.
I'm taking it seriously.
I know nothing about .
Those aren't even apples for eating anyway. They're decorative.
Decorative ? What, are you kidding ?
What ? I never heard of that in my life.
You never heard of decorative apples ?
Yes, and they're artificial.
I've never heard anybody using real fruit as for decoration purposes.
Larry, I'd feel better if we just stopped the eating for now, just long enough to get a few basic points down for the speech.
Okay, no worries.
I'll put the apple away. in my basket here.
Where are you supposed to put it ?
It's a garbage, it's a garbage can.
Larry, it's not a garbage can.
How am I supposed to know it's for paper ?
If I see a garbage can,
I throw garbage in there.
I think you're conflating garbage with paper.
You have fruit that's not for eating.
You have garbage not for garbage.
And you have a bathroom that nobody can use. It's unbelievable .
Hot off the presses, baby .
This is it. This is the scone.
What are you doing ? Are you nuts ?
Take a bite.
I have to do this speech at a Survivors United event.
Remember that psychotic assistant
I had who thought you were
Harvey Weinstein ?
This is all because of her.
I know. There's no fruit flies, nothing.
It just sits there all day looking beautiful.
Holy mackerel .
My mother would go nuts for this.
They didn't make them like that in the old days.
This is a whole new technology.
That piece of shit happens to be a scone that I'll sell at Latte Larry's.
Ugh, I don't like a scone.
You don't ? Who cares what you like ?
You have such pedestrian taste anyway.
I like a delicious, moist cupcake.
What is that ?
Remember that ?
This picture's very painful for me now.
I'm not taking it down.
It's part of our history.
I'm not gonna deny our history.
Or rewrite it.
It's a history that's very hurtful for me.
This picture being up is very offensive to me, Susie .
Put it the fuck back .
And get that fucking crusty scone out of my house, too.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and tell you, this is gonna be one of the best scones you've ever had in your life.
Are these chocolate chips or are they blueberries ?
Chips.
What ? You're crazy .
I could go out there and choke, eating this thing .
It's like a buttermilk biscuit without the butter in it.
Then don't come in the store .
Go to Mocha Joe's .
Where'd you get this ?
Cheryl gave it to me.
Hold on. Okay. Okay. It's like a fireplace cardigan is what it is.
Hey, Larry. I was just gonna call you.
He gave the biggest, the biggest donation to Survivors United.
Why didn't you tell me ?
I give to a lot of charities.
I don't tell everybody, you know.
It's really sweet.
That's part of the reason.
And I think it's a great cause.
That almost makes me cry.
That is the sweetest thing ever.
I just need a doodle from you.
It's literally like
This is a show can ?
It indicates that we know how to throw things out.
I can't believe what's going on. Same thing happened in my lawyer's office.
Well, we like to keep the place clean.
I was keeping the place clean by throwing my garbage in the garbage.
We don't even have a liner in there.
Take a look. We don't use that at all.
What do you say ?
Yeah.
Okay.
Here, taste this. It's a scone.
Who needs all this shit when you're eating a snack ?
He loves scones.
I've had coffee with Funkhouser many times.
Scones are his pastry of choice.
Yeah, by the way, what a sweater.
I don't like sweaters but that's gorgeous.
Okay, you know what ?
Here, take it.
Cheryl gave it to me and I don't like the reminder.
Well, it won't hurt me if I ever wear it.
Zaragoza.
What happened ?
You bite your tongue ?
It's Castilian.
What's Castilian mean ?
Castilian, it's a dialect of Spanish.
And they pronounce their z's as th's.
You're paying for what ? Lunch ?
That's what you think.
You are not paying because I have my own bread and I can treat you.
I know you can and you always do.
You never let me pay and I'm sick of it.
No, fuck you . And I'm paying .
Fuck you, you're not paying,
I'm paying.
Take your scones and get the hell out of here.
Yeah, with pleasure . But before I go,
I think I'll just leave you one.
Fuck you, I'm paying and I'll see you tomorrow .
You fucking idiot .
I have a reservation tomorrow.
I'm having lunch with Richard Lewis.
You know him ?
Yeah, yeah. He always comes earlier to leave us the card.
I want to pay tomorrow.
That's why I'm here 'cause
I want to leave my credit card.
It's too much responsibility because it may get stolen.
Listen, he's just gonna come very early tomorrow, he's gonna give you the credit card.
I want to pay.
Just take my credit card.
Beat him. Come earlier.
I don't want to come at, at six o' clock in the morning.
Where is Francisco ? He'll take it.
He waits on me all the time.
Unfortunately, his auntie died.
By the way, your friend Ted Danson came yesterday with a very attractive blonde.
Cecilio ? What was the name of yesterday's blonde ?
I do. Yeah.
The address of Concepción Zarzal's wake ?
Yeah. Yeah, that one.
Yeah.
Did you know my aunt, Concepcion ?
I didn't know her.
I'm sure she was a wonderful woman.
She was like a mother to me.
Let me ask you a question. Are you working at Zaragoza tomorrow ?
Zaragoza ?
Okay. Can we talk about this another time, please ?
I'd just like to get a little head start on him and just give you my credit card beforehand.
Ah. Thank you.
What, what are you doing here ?
Hey, I've already paid.
You're too late. Get lost.
Don't even start it.
Just give me that .
Give it . Give it . Give it .
You know, I didn't love it.
Don't say it's a fancy muffin. You don't know what you're talking about.
What aren't you getting ?
It's a fancy muffin.
It's like you're saying roast beef is chicken. Roast beef is not chicken.
Okay, fuck you guys.
And could you do me one favor, please ?
Can you take down that picture of me and Cheryl ? In your house ?
What the fuck ?
Holy shit.
Get used to it.
He's gonna be everywhere.
It's a big movie.
Billboards, talk shows, everywhere you look, it's gonna be Ted Danson.
Inundated, that's what we're gonna be.
He came to my house last year, asked me if he can go out with Cheryl.
I said no, but he did it anyway.
Your most vulnerable moment.
That motherfucker .
I bit my fucking tongue. Fuck.
Yeah. Stir it up real good.
Put a little tea, a little lemonade together, got a little Arnold Palmer.
Congratulations.
That motherfucker got away with that shit.
Yeah, I don't think he was the first one to do it.
Fucking right. You know how many times
I put milk and Mountain Dew together ?
And I mean, I could have my own, my own fucking drink, Leon Black.
Milk and Mountain Dew ? Disgusting.
There's certain taste buds that you motherfuckers like, but you get away with that shit,
I don't know how the fuck you get away.
Of course I am.
You motherfuckers will accept all kind of stupid shit in your mouth.
Who the fuck drinks fucking grass ?
And pig's knuckles ?
And pig's brains and pig's feet ?
Anything to do with the pig. Huh ?
Hey, man. Shit.
What the fuck is that ?
I hope your speech is better than that goddamn doodle right there.
Hey, fuckface. You really shouldn't be insulting a doodle. It's a doodle.
It's just horrible.
You fucking kidding me, man ?
What the fuck ?
That's artificial fruit .
What the fuck, Larry ?
What are you eating artificial fruit for ?
Who the fuck puts artificial fruit on the table ?
I don't know. I saw it at Jeff's house.
I liked it.
Don't put the thing on the table in the fucking kitchen .
What the fuck
I'm supposed to do with it ?
I don't know. You couldn't tell ?
They serve eggs without toast.
Is that an answer ? What is that ?
It's, it's imbecilic.
Why is it imbecilic ?
They're, they're a team.
You are like a president in the 18th century on the back of a train, saying, And there will always be toast with eggs .
And two turkeys in every garage .
All right. Thank you very much.
You're driving him nuts, man.
I told you before.
I didn't want to see it anymore.
What kind of gift is that ? I'll wear whatever I want. It's mine now.
This is selfish. It's very selfish.
I want you to take off that fucking sweater.
Hey, get out of here.
Hey, hey, hey, what the fuck you're doing ?
No. Don't touch me.
Yeah. Thank you.
And, Seńor Lewis.
What ? What are you talking about ?
No, no, no, no, no.
I gave Francisco my credit card.
Francisco's not here. He's mourning the death of his aunt, Concepción Zarzal.
Generous tip, by the way. As usual.
Am I right or am I wrong ?
I don't want to get you sick.
Most people don't do that.
They keep it to themselves.
You know what you're doing ?
You know, Larry, I just wanted to take this moment to say how grateful I am for you to be here.
You know what you're gonna say yet ?
I think you can introduce me sort of as a renaissance man.
You know, a guy who speaks six languages.
No, I only speak one language. Yeah.
I know a little bit of Yiddish.
What then ? What's up ?
What a nut. A terrible temper.
You know, a couple of things
No, you just say these things.
It will impress them.
You want to impress people with lies ?
Well, how else do you impress them ?
All right. Introduce me any way you'd like. How about that ?
Okay.
By the way, you know,
I have a friend, Marty Funkhouser.
His daughter is transitioning to be a man.
That's beautiful.
Yeah. Hey, can I ask you a question about the whole transitioning thing ?
And on my driver's license it says
I'm an organ donor.
How about this one ? Could a white transitioner get a black penis ?
Okay. I think I got it.
I think I understand.
All righty, Larry.
See you out there.
Larry, how are you ?
How about this, huh ?
Nice event, huh ?
Okay, take it off . Okay ?
I want you to take it off .
I gave mine to Richard 'cause
I didn't want to be reminded of it and now you're reminding me of it.
Larry, stop it. He's got a polo shirt on under this. We're at an event.
Yeah, I got a golf shirt.
I can't take this off.
Okay. What about it ?
It's terrible, Larry. We can't use this.
You said it doesn't matter what it looks like. It's a doodle.
No, this is a doodle.
This is Christine Lahti's.
This is beautiful.
That is not a doodle.
That is a work of art, okay ?
This, what, a nickel ?
I'll give you two pence.
You're not holding the right way.
You hold it like this.
Let's get it framed.
Yeah, it could be anything. It could be a rollercoaster. It could be a shoe.
It could be a large intestine.
You gotta think a little bit .
You know what it is ?
It's what you find in a large intestine.
It is. It is. Honestly.
That's what I think of it. Okay ?
Because we can't sell it.
We can't do anything with it.
I don't know.
You're known for other things, not your activism or your advocacy for women.
I've spent a good deal of my life advocating for women.
That's advocacy in a way, in that I'm pursuing them.
I want them. I'm advocating for them by pursuing them.
Right. Okay.
Did you do a doodle ?
No, it's not on the wall.
It's not on the wall.
I like it. I think it's very well done.
How long did it take you to do that ?
I mean, maybe twenty minutes.
Half, half an hour.
Yeah, but that's not a doodle.
That is not a doodle.
Yeah, this is like the Louvre.
I mean, come on. You know what ?
What was yours like ?
That's the beauty of a doodle.
You don't know what it is.
Okay, did you put any effort into it ?
I put the same amount of effort
I put into the doodle as I would if I was talking on the phone, doodling, which is to say none.
Larry, Larry, if you don't put effort into it,
You know, that you don't have to put any effort into anything.
Well, then, why didn't you put effort into it ?
None of them are doodles.
What is that ?
What is that ? A doodle ?
That's a speech that I'll be giving that you'll be listening to and apologizing to me later for ever talking to me like this.
I don't think so.
Who wrote that ? Your assistant ?
I wrote it. And it took a lot less time than it took for you to do that painting
I can tell you that.
Ladies and gentlemen, Laverne Cox.
Good afternoon.
Now, I know these events can be triggering, but I want to remind you that you are more than your pain.
I want to remind you that you are more than what happened to you.
Our first speaker, you know him as the cocreator of the legendary sitcom Seinfeld.
You're the heroes. You're the heroes.
Asshole .
You're such a disgrace .
Why would you even come here ?
Should've told 'em you have a cold .
Well, what was I supposed to do ?
She had a cold.
She had a cold.
You're supposed to kiss her.
I mean, Larry, the optics were terrible.
This was the way out, do you understand that ?
This was supposed to be the olive branch.
Okay. Okay, okay. I'll make out with Laverne Cox on national television.
No, forget that.
How about a nice hug.
I'll give her a hug. You know ?
All right. We'll spitball.
Don't come up with any more ideas. Okay ?
Our problem is that Alice does not feel that what happened was a good faith fulfillment agreement.
That's insane .
Well, that's the price of buying back your legacy, my friend.
Wait, wait, I got an idea.
Remember that old
Whatever that was ?
I'll be in bed with Laverne Cox.
We get a picture, you know.
How about this ? I think there is one last glimmer of hope, if we're lucky enough to execute it, and that is to sit down face to face one last time, if they will have it, with Alice and her attorneys, and explain that what happened was a legitimate misunderstanding.
You know what ? I think you should put me on the phone with that attorney.
Black women really like me.
Let me set up the meeting, and then we'll go from there.
Good.
Yeah. Maybe I overreacted last time.
Have one.
Wow . Very proud of you .
You are making progress.
I chipped my tooth .
I didn't think you'd bite it.
It was artificial .
Then what the fuck did you offer it to me for ?
I thought you'd pick it up and think it was great .
Shove it up your ass .
I'm gonna kill that bastard.
I should sue him .
At least yours was an accident.
My lawyer, he offered me the fruit on purpose.
At least I didn't offer it to you.
Well, now you know how I feel.
You smirked when I bit it. You smirked.
There was no smirk. Get out of here.
He can't see me till tomorrow ?
I need that ? It's emergency .
Hello ?
Suspicious activity ?
On my credit card ?
A thousand dollars of papas bravas, manchego cheese paella ?
No . I didn't order that, but I know who did . Francisco Zarzal .
Cancel my credit card .
Come on. We have to find Francisco Zarzal.
He played you for a fucker.
He played you for a straight fucker.
It's just stealing, plain and simple.
It's bullshit . This is bullshit .
Bullshit. Straight bullshit.
He played us for suckers.
I chipped my tooth. How about you ?
My tongue's all torn. Sucks .
I have to call Zaragoza. See if I can track down Francisco Zarzal.
That's it.
Excuse me. Have you seen
Francisco Zarzal ?
He's a server at Zaragoza.
No, I haven't seen Francisco.
I don't see him anywhere.
You know what I see ?
I see everything I paid for.
Yeah. I paid for that, too.
Come on, let's eat.
Hey, where the fuck you're going ?
I'm already going this way .
Give me a plate.
You have to have toast when you eat eggs. It's a necessity.
What are you even doing here ?
Ah, Francisco .
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hello, Francisco. It seems as if you've been using my credit card.
What do you have to say for yourself ?
This is not a conversation to have at the reception of Concepción Zarzal.
Will you repeat that, please ?
I don't think this is a conversation to have at the reception of Concepción Zarzal.
What's this, charges from Zaragoza ?
Similar ? How are they similar ?
The names are certainly not the same.
One says Larry David, the other says Francisco Zarzal.
It's not Tharthal, it's Zarzal.
You're making fun of the way we speak.
No. No, I'm not making fun.
My tooth is chipped.
You're making fun of us.
You're disrespecting us.
Motherfuckers .
Get your hands off me .
Don't throw me in the garbage can .
Sir, the Union broke through our lines, and our troops have retreated across the Appomattox.
Gentlemen, I believe
I don't think we should speak unless our attorneys are present.
She had a cold.
You made a mockery of the entire event.
You made a mockery of sexual harassment survivors.
And you violated the terms of our agreement.
I think we should just wait for the lawyers.
Yeah, I had a whole speech prepared.
It was a great speech.
I talked about Gloria Steinem.
You know, I had a picture of her up on my wall when I was a teenager.
She was really attractive.
That's just completely inappropriate.
Okay. You know what ?
Are you hungry ?
Don't, don't move. Stay right there.
If the elevators come,
I'm getting in one.
Okay. All right.
This is a scone. They're fantastic.
Why do you have these ?
I'm opening up a store.
Try it. You'll love it.
Thank you.
Pretty good, right ?
Yeah, darn right, they're good.
Dry ?
I can't breathe.
You want the Heimlich ?
END OF EPISODE 3Making progress, huh?
People coming and going all the time. was gonna be this much work.
There's got to be spite, but it's just still got to be
Ugh.
What? What are you talking about?
We had a ten o'clock appointment.
Hey, playboy. Listen here, man.
People don't have fuckin' time sittin around here, waitin' for yo' ass.
If you say ten o'clock, you show the fuck up at ten o'clock.
I'm comin', I'm comin', you don't get the fuck up and go in the kitchen and make a goddamn ham sandwich, do you?
You get your ass over here, and you don't fuckin' hold this man up.
Coordinate this shit.
Don't serve those,
Those shits make my throat hurt.
Can't breathe.
Oh.
Aah.
Non compos mentis?
She's got memory loss.
Eh, I like 'em.
Just came by to remind you what great coffee tastes like.
Brought one for your buddy there, too.
Hey, fuck you, Vanilla Joe.
Kiss my ass.
I can't believe you're wasting your money on this shithole.
Remember, Larry.
Good coffee is all about the beans.
You don't have the beans.
See ya. Enjoy the coffee.
Damn.
You got to have the fuckin beans to have the best coffee.
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
Thank you.
Oh.
We're never gonna beat Mocha Joe's beans.
Knock off Westside Tavern.
By the way, the dignity that you lose by tucking it in,
Who tucks in?
Al Capone, you know.
Yeah, no one's gonna question him.
I don't know, man. Cabo?
I mean, why do you have to make people travel two hours to go to a wedding? get me to say anything bad about Mickey.
I'm not trying to get you to say anything bad about Mickey.
Hey. Why don't we split a plane?
Let's go nuts.
Yeah?
You're not invited to the wedding.
Nah, fuck the wedding.
I'm going with you.
Tagging along with you.
All right. You have to chip in.
You want to tag along,
Consider me your luggage.
Bring me on the fuckin' plane, put a seatbelt around me, and I won't say shit.
By the way, luggage doesn't eat.
Or talk.
Or chip in.
Are, are you walking out?
It's like throwing out paper.
Why don't you just leave it on your table?
No, I can't do that.
It's, it's unsightly.
You don't want that.
You forget, then it goes in the wash and it ruins the pants.
You don't have one.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I'll go with you.
Thank you.
That's it. I'm done. you're having a pretty tremendous time, aren't you?
People always have a great time in sushi bars cause they don't have to look at each other.
I steal a glance.
Mm. What are you doing next weekend?
Usually, that's like, a fifth, sixth, seventh date kind of thing. in, in the same room.
You don't have anything to worry about.
You would sleep on the couch.
I'd make sure it's a comfortable couch.
Could I have a pillow?
I think we can get you a pillow.
You think about it.
I was in Cabo.
Yes. I have pictures.
Yeah. Well, I mean, I know,
I lost a lot of weight.
How long ago was that?
I don't know.
No, no, no.
It's, it's like, if you saw a picture of me with hair a year ago, and then you met me and I was bald, you'd be disturbed, too.
Are we on a first date?
We don't need dessert.
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?
I definitely want this. Try one.
Mm. Mm.
I looked at that picture, I almost fainted.
I had to ask her,
Is that you? That's what I said to her.
You know what the fuck that means?
All signs point to her
She ate this big dessert.
You are in a fucked up position right now.
I know.
Did you ever find the old one?
Did you ever see that?
No. Never seen it.
Weird.
I got to ask her her weight now?
What's your weight, by the way?
I'm gonna need it.
They, they just asked for it.
It's for safety.
If that pilot needs my weight to fly that plane safely, he need another fuckin' plane.
And you need to keep an eye on your girl over there for eating that garbage in Mexico.
Suppose I took your tray like this.
Come on, Larry, stop fuckin' around.
Fuck you, Larry.
Look at this.
I didn't know you were coming.
What a surprise.
You're invited to Mickey's wedding?
You know, you just, you don't invite a divorced couple to a wedding.
It's a very combustible situation.
Who, who knows what could happen?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Cheryl, you're gonna come on the plane with us, right?
We're flying private.
Yeah, we're all splitting a plane.
Are you inviting me to hop on?
I'm inviting you to hop on and chip in. you're coming on the plane, you got to chip in.
Well, you're already going, right?
People resent you if you don't chip in.
Okay, fine. Yes. I will chip in.
By the way, it might interest you to know that I'll be bringing a date.
And you're complaining that divorced couples shouldn't come when you're bringing a virtual stranger?
We get along quite well.
All right.
I need your weights, by the way.
This is a regulation.
You're not gonna give me your weight?
She doesn't even know how much I weigh. how much I weigh? My doctor.
My weight?
My business. No one knows.
I'd rather be dead in the Sea of Cortez than have you know what I weigh.
No, the captain's for a boat.
How do you wanna be referred to?
If you said to me, From now on,
I want to be referred to as Goat Williker,
The pilot wants your weight.
You can tell the pilot that Goat Williker doesn't give his weight to anyone.
That's right.
And neither does Mrs Williker.
You should see everything they have.
They'll be talking about us when we leave.
They'll say what pigs we are.
You know, we just ate everything.
We're gonna have to make an unscheduled landing.
Nothing's wrong with the plane.
And now, now we're over.
It's none of your business what I put down for you.
It is my business.
Okay, folks.
It doesn't matter how we got here.
The fact of the matter is that we're here now, and we're overweight.
We're beginning our initial descent.
Please fasten your seat belts.
Aah. Where the fuck are we?
We'll, we'll shoot for it.
You don't get a second chance, Larry.
It's not the damn playoffs.
We got to get going, or we'll miss our slot in Cabo.
All right. Thank you.
Honestly, this is ridiculous.
Is this not ridiculous?
You know, we paid a lot of money for this plane.
And I don't know why you assholes couldn't give me your weight.
We're gonna go look at the view. Come on.
It doesn't get better than this.
It doesn't get better.
Leon. You coming to the wedding?
You figured one of us wouldn't come is what you figured. Right?
I promised Sasha
I'd get a manicure.
Marriage. It's a commitment.
Okay, see ya.
Okay, I am not going to say anything bad about Mickey.
Well, I am not going to say anything bad about Mickey.
All right.
Don't say anything bad about Mickey.
Nothing bad about Mickey coming out of me.
Let's check this place out.
How do you not have toothbrushes at the front desk?
There was nothing, nothing at the store.
This is it? Are you kidding?
This is the great room?
He said it was great.
I don't consider this great.
Hey, you know,
She's hates me.
She's not gonna loan me anything.
Aah, she kind of hates everybody.
But you know what?
I'll take care of Susie.
I know just how to handle her.
She'll be eating out of your hand.
What'd you estimate for my weight for that flight?
What'd you tell the pilot, Larry?
You know, don't tell the others
I said 122.
Oh.
You know what?
You know what I'm thinking?
I want to make a good
It's fine. We're going rogue.
It's Mexico.
You never know. It's possible.
Wow.
Mickey said they'd be great rooms.
Yeah, great rooms.
You're hardly gonna be in it.
It's not a big deal.
You don't happen to have an extra toothbrush around, do you?
You know, like your luggage being thrown off a plane.
How are things going with Donna?
Oy, that one.
Why the snarky attitude toward a fellow Jew?
She's Jewish?
Big bat mitzvah. neither of you have an extra toothbrush?
Go back to your little fucking hovel, with your unbrushed teeth.
Go. Now.
Okay.
Drive, motherfucker.
Fuck that red light.
Come in. It's open.
Turn down the alley.
Turn down the fuckin' alley.
Goddamn.
How'd you get a room like this?
You're not even going to the wedding.
They give you a bigger room just 'cause you say you're handicapped?
If they ask too many questions, then I throw a limp on their ass.
You've got all the tricks, don't you?
Do you think the maid is gonna charge me for the massage she gave me?
You know, I don't want that shit to show up on the fuckin' bill.
You know what I mean?
Cause she didn't mention it.
Are you kidding?
How's your room?
I said to you guys, The rooms are great.
Congratulations.
It's late.
She's not wrong.
Do you happen to have an extra toothbrush, by any chance?
We do have an extra toothbrush.
You have an extra toothbrush.
Fantastic.
What do you mean?
I have an emergency.
It's an emergency.
I don't have a toothbrush.
But that's your emergency.
You're not gonna have an emergency.
What makes you think
It's a fluke emergency.
A toothbrush emergency,
I won't have a toothbrush emergency.
And you know why I know that?
Because I have a goddamn extra toothbrush.
Anyway, come on, Larry.
Don't even look at it.
Larry?
I've got a little box.
Everybody has a better room than me.
We were married.
I've used your toothbrush before.
Same mouth, the mouth is the same.
I'd rather not.
Look at the esteem that I hold your mouth in.
I wouldn't use anybody else's toothbrush but I'm, I'm gonna shorten it just, just for you.
Thank you. I'll take the floss to go.
I told 'em I had to be here. I didn't want you to be down here by yourself.
No, wait, wait. Ted.
What are you doing? What?
Fuck. What's going on, man?
I didn't have a toothbrush.
Why are you in my bathroom?
You gonna throw that away?
I mean, if you don't want it,
I'll take it. toothbrushing streak.
I couldn't let it fall by the wayside.
If Cal Ripkin was missing his spikes for one game, you think he wouldn't borrow a pair of spikes,
Okay, Larry.
Now this is clean, right?
Yeah. Okay.
Larry, it doesn't matter.
All right. Yeah.
Throw it in the bathtub.
Well? Find anything?
Why do you smell minty?
Oh.
I used my finger.
This does not smell like a minty finger.
I used Tom's.
There's no discernible odor.
Not a great room, like you said.
Chocolate.
I guess.
Well, well.
Look what we have here.
This is not like five MandM's.
This is like a cudgel, this thing.
It's, it's actually very small.
In weight, it's not really that big.
All right. Well, you know what?
I have to call the front desk,
Of course I do.
Hey, this is Larry David in room 462.
Well, yeah. You're very welcome.
Okay. Buenos noches.
Well.
Shall we proceed with the tawdry business?
Yes.
I was wondering if you could tell me, is there a place in town where I could get clothes for a wedding, for a man and a woman?
Yes, yes, of course, sir.
They have a little carnival today.
Housekeeping called, and they took care of that stain no problem, for you.
What'd you say?
It's all taken care of.
You said they put it on my bill?
Are you out of your mind?
I called you up.
You thank me?
How are you thanking me?
By charging me $250?
That's not thanking.
Suppose I walked in the room and saw the stain on the couch and called you up and said,
There's a stain on the couch?
Don't you see what's wrong here?
You're punishing me for being honest.
I don't give a shit about the couch.
What do you think about that?
I don't care if you fix it or not.
Hey. Is everything okay?
Hey, mind your own business, Mickey.
Ah, buenos dias.
Livin' it up, huh?
I'm just gonna have a raspberry.
Always a gamble.
There's always a possibility of mold.
You got to really inspect 'em.
They're worth it.
I don't bite 'em.
What do you do then?
What do you do then? Exactly.
Hey.
Will you be joining us on the way back on the plane?
You're disrespecting the captain?
I am not disrespecting the captain.
I don't think you understand.
This is a captain.
Yeah, my understanding was this was couples, babe.
And we're a couple, Larry.
Okay.
Good morning.
Hey.
Don't give me any grief on this.
Okay? I just got an email from the captain.
No, you mean the pilot.
Okay. This is neither here nor there.
We need weights.
No, no, no. It's here and there.
He could be Captain fuckin' Nemo.
You're not getting my weight.
By the way, last night
I went to Mickey's room.
I'm not gonna say anything bad about Mickey.
You can play your games to try and manipulate me
I'm just telling you facts, okay?
Cause everybody's going. It was presented to me like it would be fun.
Come here, sit down.
I always carry an extra dress in case there's a dress emergency.
It's gonna look gorgeous on you.
It'll fit you to a T.
It's elegant, stunning.
If it fits you, you could keep it.
No more worries.
Now, what's your last name, sweetheart?
I don't give my weight, or my fuckin' height.
That's called a goddamn description of a motherfucker. you got to try this coffee.
It's the best fuckin' coffee
I ever had in my fuckin' life.
Watch what the fuck happens to your goddamn mouth right now.
Leon.
Holy shit. Leon, this is good.
Mocha Joe can't fuck with this right here.
Hey. Of course I fuckin' did.
You better. Woo.
Thanks.
Hello, sir.
Yes. I caused the stain.
I should pay for it.
You are 100 percents right.
We appreciate that you understand it was your fault.
Although, let's face it. I mean, you could have been sports about it.
But, you know,
You know what.
And I got to say, it was the most delicious cup of coffee I've ever had in my life.
They are the hotel's proprietary beans.
They have been passed down from generation to generation, and the family specifically asked that we keep it a secret.
She only has a few months to live.
And the only pleasure in life that she gets at all is from her morning coffee.
May I ask what's wrong with her?
You can't move a muscle in her body.
Ah. How can she drink the coffee?
All she can do, really, is lift the cup up to her lips and swallow.
Literally that is all she can do.
I would like to extend to you and your family my deepest, sincerest regards for her.
But we can't do anything about the beans.
You know what? Bring her here.
Like I just said, she can't travel, she can't move.
She's incapacitated. You gonna give me the name of the beans or not?
I'm never coming back here again for the rest of my life.
What's, what's the name of that place for the clothes, again?
Yeah. It's supposed to be fun.
I love it. I don't know what you said to Susie.
Whatever it was, it was magic.
I know what makes her tick.
Yes, you do, 'cause she's my best friend.
Hey, look at this.
I think we should go play like a carnival game.
Okay, okay. Señora, give me a little turn. 163 pounds, señor.
Good job.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
I would guess the lady weighs 155 pounds, señor.
What?
Who told you to say that out loud?
How dare you.
You said she weighs 155 pounds?
Why, you charlatan. You quack.
You have besmirched this woman's honor.
I've got a good mind to take this up with the carnival commission.
Is there a carnival commission?
Then I won't take it up.
But you'll be hearing from me again.
You know what?
I've got more to say to him.
Ernesto, you stink.
Thank you very much.
You did a fantastic job.
I've got five people coming later.
I want you to guess their weights, too.
You hear me?
I got a good mind to punch you in the face.
No.
Who are you looking for?
I thought you wanted to shop.
No.
Huh.
This is really cute.
Jeff, you gonna win me a prize?
Right back.
Hey, look at this.
Let's do a little dance.
Yeah, that's good.
Terrific. Hey, Leon.
Putting a towel on the floor.
Ah, you know, I had a couple of drinks.
How the fuck do I know?
What are you asking me for?
Cause you're an asshole.
What was that?
You are, Donna, a vision.
I can't even tell you.
Elegant, classic, gorgeous.
I think she should keep it.
What's going on here?
Are you our man in Havana?
I like you in color.
Hey. I'll be back.
Might as well give me the whole fuckin' bottle.
Walking back and forth,
Beans.
You barely made it, barely.
You should hear
Hey, Larry.
Guess what I found under Cheryl's bed?
You've been sleeping with Cheryl.
You've been doing it for a while, too.
Haven't you?
That's why you were in our room last night
You said you brushed with your finger.
You bring me all the way down here, you're sleeping with your exwife?
No, not last night.
Aah. Larry.
Holy shit.
What the fuck, Larry?
Are you all right?
I mean, seriously.
What the fuck is your problem?
This is why you don't invite divorced couples to a wedding, Mickey.
Larry, nobody likes you.
You can fuck off, too, Jeff.
Fuck you, Mickey.
He's gonna play golf with him.
Mickey.
What a fucking asshole.
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna need your weights before you guys can get on.
You're not getting in my weight.
I need the weight before we can leave.
No, I'm afraid it is happening.
I have the weights.
How do you have the weights?
Because the carnival barker, in all of Mexico
Okay.
That's diabolical, Lar.
I must say, uh, there were a couple of surprises in there.
We want the paper back.
I'm not gonna say a word to anybody.
No, it's not the passengers. It's the cargo. bags of beans.
They're all gonna have to go.
Gag gift?
No, that's a real gift.
You've never had one?
You cuddle it.
Whatever your journey is.
What exactly do you see in this man?
I've got a lot of ideas for the urinals.
You wanna redesign a urinal?
Your feet never touch the ground.
Do you know what it takes to stand up there for 90 minutes,
It must be quite grueling.
Yeah. Shortstop.
I can't play short.
Making errors every, every time I played.
It's hard playing infield with polio, you know?
Well, you know what?
I'm throwing it out.
Do you believe all this shit my parents saved?
I'm getting rid of all of it.
I can't stand it anymore.
Should drop this shit off at a nursing home.
I'm sending it to the dry cleaner.
Those are making a big comeback, too.
See, when they wore those things, ladies and gentlemen carried themselves a certain way.
All the, all the guys called the ladies toots. Hey, toots.
It gets a rise out of guys and shit.
That would get a rise out of you? A woman going,
I'd know I'm tappin' that ass.
Ah. A text from Jeff.
Big fuckin' deal, man. Clive Owen, man.
All right.
Must have been nice.
Tappin' that ass back in the days.
Fuckin' in black and white.
Hey. Larry.
Have a nice day.
I got a package from discreet shipping.
The fuck could that be?
Freddy Funkhouser. joke right here, man.
The new ones, they got one that's sensitive around the fuckin' neck.
You could put hickeys on that motherfucker if you wanted to, man.
I got a lot of ideas for the urinals.
That has to be eliminated.
What I wanted, I want
What if they get urine on the planks?
Well, that can't happen, because of this.
That, my friend, is the pee cube.
You pee into the cube, and there's a chute that goes down.
And then on the other side, I'll put two or three floor toilets. Correct?
No, there's no toilets.
There's no defecation here.
Look, there's no defecation in the building.
Could you do that?
Penis detected. Woot.
The door will open up, and then once the man is done,
Slide down.
I'd like to introduce you to Mr Ted Danson.
You think you're up for this fight, General Lee?
Yeah. I'm gonna look forward to spiting your spite store.
Well,
I do declare. As I recall,
General Lee was a loser.
Another week without wind.
Before this journey, my life was bereft of the wind of purpose.
Now I have the purpose, but without the wind.
Now there are no days, no nights.
Even my parrot Lorita has perished.
I give my last will and testament to the waves, who refuse to weep with me.
My final epitaph written in the froth and the foam.
Really. Clive was so good. I really loved the show.
I'm not just saying that.
It was a great show.
I got a better idea.
What are you doing?
Jesus fucking Christ, you're amazing.
And I folded your laundry by color and style.
And today I'm gonna clean your makeup brushes.
You're a fucking saint.
I love this girl.
She's amazing.
I'm telling you, she takes initiative.
I've never had a housekeeper that does this.
Lar, she just told me this morning moved out of town.
She's got an opening she's trying to fill.
All right. She's yours.
I'm gonna go tell her.
But keep Leon away from her, please.
That I can't guarantee.
What are you thinking about?
Why'd you send a doll like that to my house?
Hey, Freddy.
Where's my section?
Uncle Moke, just look around. You'll find it.
Take a look around.
You'll find it. You like it?
You cuddle it, whatever your journey is.
That's where we're at.
No disease.
You got a good imagination, same thing.
The doll is whatever you want it to be.
Maybe you should try necrophilia.
Now you're picking
I'm not saying that.
If I want to fuck a dead woman,
I'll fuck the doll. Okay? And that way,
I don't have to fuck a dead woman.
He met a girl, a real girl, no doll.
No problem. He's gonna buy it. I'm a buyer.
Moke.
All the free porn on the Internet.
Why stick with magazines?
Yeah. My kids bought me a computer, but I don't use it.
Well, Moke, everything here is a click away on the Internet.
Come on.
Don't kid me.
Thanks a lot.
Now, Carol, what exactly do you see in this man?
What kind of question is that?
What's wrong with dark clothes? I always wear black.
He thinks people are aware that he dresses in black.
Nobody gives a fuck.
Is anyone else cold?
Are you cold?
Do you have any problem if we turn on the heat lamp?
Well, but we have seven people here and we're fine.
Yeah, I, I, I know, but she's cold, and it's worse to be cold, than hot.
No, it's actually worse to be hot than cold.
Okay, well, that's a good point, if there are more things to put on.
But there aren't more things to put on.
Look, we're not snowmen.
It's in my car. Let me go get it.
I really appreciate that, Larry.
You know what?
Actually, uh, this reminds me of a stole my mother had when I was a little girl.
She used to wrap me up in it to keep me warm.
Yeah. And I remember when I was 12, my dad and mom took me to see La Cage aux Folles.
Yeah, I remember.
That was on Broadway, yeah.
It was such a great night.
I, I want you to have it.
The poor thing. Imagine seeing your mother get hit by a train, going after a mink stole, ugh.
The horns, do you think of the horns?
I mean, how do you even go to work after that?
She's a professional crier.
What? A what?
She's a professional crier.
What's wrong with you?
What are you worried about?
I'm worried I just got fleeced for a mink stole.
Have you guys ever had a disagreement of any kind, where perhaps she started crying?
She wanted Chinese,
I wanted Italian.
And you had Chinese food.
She fucking conned me out of that mink stole. This is incredible.
You witnessed it.
And the horn, the horn.
I want that stole back, okay?
I clean all the windows and all the mantles.
That's a doll.
They're like, uh, big teddy bears. Yeah.
You collect big plastic dolls?
They normally come with clothes.
You know, they come with a lot of different outfits.
Like the American Girl.
Right, right.
Yeah, they have a nurse's outfit, they have a flight attendant, a cheerleader.
Anyway, I just want you to know, you're doing a fantastic job.
Thank you.
She's like F this,
The thing is, I have kind of an agreement with her. all I can say is that
I have another family that I need to work with on
I am done with Miss Susie.
Okay.
Hey, do anchovies only go on pizza?
Come here, come here.
You blew it up?
Yeah, I mean, I got her out of the box. Give her a little air and shit.
I wanna see what the fuck she was working with.
You didn't try and get a little friendly with her, did you?
What the fuck you trying to say? a little friendly with her, Leon?
Why do you always look at me like this?
I'm trying to look into your fuckin' brain.
You think you're better than me, Leon Black?
I wouldn't put it past you, let's just say that.
Get rid of that fucking thing.
Be cool, Sherry.
And Carol broke up with me. she wept openly,
That's how she got the mink in the first place.
Yeah, well, you ruined another woman for me.
I could've had a baby with this woman and maybe become a father.
A baby? You're 200 years old. You're gonna have a baby?
Do me a favor.
Just stay out of my affairs.
Meanwhile, she still has the mink, okay? And I'm gettin' it back.
Aah, bullshit.
What the hell is that?
Come on.
I'll introduce you to her.
You breached.
She was quitting.
She wasn't working for you on Mondays and Wednesdays, that was it.
She doesn't wanna work here.
She can't stand you.
You use disgusting language around her.
She's a strict Catholic girl.
You're gonna wrap those babies up, and you're dropping 'em off at my office.
And when you drop off those biscuits, you're gonna pick up my laundry and take it to the Fluff and Fold.
And look at me, I'm putting out premade fuckin' salads from Metzler's.
Yeah. And then
I gotta clean up myself.
I don't know how to do this fucking shit.
I'll help you clean up.
Did you know that? I can put my hands in boiling, scalding water, and I don't feel anything.
I'll stick my hands in the sink right now. Put it on as hot as you want.
I'll stick 'em under any hot water you can find, okay?
That's insane.
Listen to me.
Clive's coming over.
Clive seems to think it was insufficient praise.
Yeah.
You weren't enthusiastic. you gotta almost give your own performance about how much you loved it.
All right. You know what?
That's him.
Okay?
And by the way, you're doing the dishes when we're done.
Yeah.
Yes. When I would leave a message on, on, on a woman's phone,
I would always get in trouble and the relationship would be over. I'm just no good at it.
Yeah, but the weird thing is, you know, if you go and see a play and you don't like it, you kind of don't leave a message, do you?
I just want to say I really enjoyed the show. Good job.
Yeah. Like I said, I'm not,
I mean, it's hard to do now.
It's hard to just do it on command.
Raymond Massey as Lincoln.
You never see that.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
This is unbelievable.
This Metzler's?
Best, the best.
You see that?
That is genuine praise.
You know, that, that kind of thing, that's not for people.
That's for sandwiches,
Stand up there for 90 minutes,
Must be quite grueling.
Is he for real?
No, I'm just saying.
That's what you thought when you came to see the play?
Well, kinda.
Hi. How you doin',
Lionel?
How you doin', there,
Mr Danson?
Just need your signature real quick.
You're friends with
Larry David, right?
Yeah, I suppose.
He's fucking a doll.
What? fuck doll to his house.
How could you possibly know that?
The package said,
Do not puncture. Discreet delivery.
Mailmen know.
Have a great day.
He's basically sticking his penis in a balloon.
Good to see you.
I do well. I do well.
I've been thinking about the stole.
I had to give it to you.
Or did I give it to, you know, the professional crier?
Cause that would be bad. 'Cause then I would feel like I was duped.
You know. Who knows what else you've cried your way into.
The couch, the coffee table, the painting.
Those tears were real,
I obviously cry in real life, too.
There, there, there it is.
See?
No, you're very good at this.
Larry. Larry. with Uncle Moke with the Internet porn.
Ah, you know, it's, it's better than, than paying money for those magazines.
No, it's all day. It's a problem. It's all he does.
And he is paying.
He's doing the chat rooms now.
It's addiction.
I think you should step in.
I gotta think about it. I don't know what to do. I gotta, you know,
Hey, did you hit the doll up yet?
Shit. Got the prototype done, huh?
That shit ain't deep enough.
Hmm.
What are you doing?
He's a mess.
His shows are not as good.
It's affecting his performances.
Oh.
She's a professional crier.
What the hell is that?
That, my stout friend, is a urinal revolution.
She's a good ship, the Kon Tiki.
I named her Kon Tiki in memory of the Peruvian sun god.
And here I am, following in Tiki's footsteps.
My only companion was a parrot that had snuck aboard.
She's got my mother's stole on.
She's wearing the stole.
I have the purpose, but not the wind.
Ah. There.
She's gonna start.
I am completely alone.
Even my parrot Lorita has perished.
Perished.
Lorita.
Perished.
Look out.
It's really catching on now.
I give my last will and testament to the waves who refuse to weep with me.
My final epitaph written in the froth and the foam.
Pity the man, who thought he could go back in time.
Goodbye, Kon Tiki.
No.
From a distance, could it be?
Praise be.
Yeah. Yeah.
Bravo. Wow.
Thank you. Worked like a charm. She did great.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yeah, it was really special.
I really got to see you do your thing. the more I'm convinced that what you did at the table at lunch that day was total bullshit. if I ever heard one.
Hey.
What's going on?
Okay. She's a professional crier, and she conned her way into getting that stole off me.
He gave me this stole.
My mother passed away.
And this stole reminds me of her. about being in a subway.
But she took that stole from me.
That's my mother's stole.
Stop. Stop it. Hey. Hey, guy.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm crying, Larry.
Excuse me.
You seemed very moved.
Your performance was incredible.
It was amazing.
I'm Clive.
I know.
Leon.
Leon, where's my jacket?
Leon.
Leon.
Leon. What the hell's going on?
You said you were going to deflate it.
I think you gave it a name.
You're keeping it around the house.
You can't get rid of this thing.
You're fuckin' her, aren't you?
I'm not gonna sit here and let you do this shit to me right now.
Okay.
Well, you know what?
Say goodbye to her, cause I'm deflating her right now.
Fuck you, Larry.
Be good, Sherry.
Mr Larry.
Asco.
I quit. You're worse than Miss Susie.
No, I'm just deflating her.
No. Wait. No.
God.
Hey, do me a favor.
Just the one line from the review.
Want to hear it in your beautiful, dulcet tones.
Okay, here we go.
It says,
Clive Owen's portrayal of Thor Heyerdahl is as nuanced, varied, and moving as the ocean he traversed.
Thank you, honestly.
Thank you for making it all happen.
Best reviews I've ever had.
Thank you, Clive.
I have to go to work.
I haven't even asked you what you do.
I'm a professional crier.
Bye, baby.
Bye, guys.
Carol.
I get paid to go to, you know,
TV shows, commercials.
When you were crying in the play, was that, was that a job or was that real?
No. No, it was real.
I mean, it was 10 percents more,
None of this has been real.
No, no, it isn't fake, actually, Clive.
Is that what you want to hear? It's fake.
Carol, no. Carol.
Enjoy.
Stay off the Internet.
Leon. Leon. Where are you?
Ooh.
I'm having a surprise party for Jeff for his birthday.
Why did you pass me?
Did you hear footsteps behind you?
I heard footsteps and then, whoosh. Right past me.
You should've moved over to the right to let me pass.
You should've given me one of these.
You don't have a sticker.
Yeah, I'm just gonna be a minute.
Two minutes at the most.
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Jane.
But you can't park here, because it's handicapped.
You know what,
Mocha Jane?
There are no spaces in this lot. and drop this off.
Joseph told me about you.
We're gonna take you down,
Latte Larry.
We shall see, Mocha Jane.
We shall see.
What is this world coming to?
Hey, do me a favor.
Put those in storage.
Hey, hey. before the gladiators started fighting.
It looks like it.
The bones are great.
We got tables here, okay?
And what are they gonna have next to them?
A little coat rack.
And Purell, every table.
A little squirt, and you're ready for your muffin.
Who's coming in? Howie
Mandel and his family every day?
All right. Okay. Forget that.
Now I want to show you the thing I'm most proud of.
That's what I want to see.
Welcome to the 21st century bathroom.
Look. First you got the snow shoes down there.
You step on those.
See how it lifts up?
Okay, now, watch this.
You set it to your level
I feel like I'm with Howard
Hughes right before the nails go big.
No, I do.
Let 'em go home. buyer than a defecator.
How about the ladies?
What do they got?
Look. Look at this. Look at this.
See, this is smart. The ladies get to sit down.
Women don't want to sit.
See? Grab onto these bars, then the knees go in here.
They don't touch anything.
They're not touching.
That's what they don't like.
They don't like touching the toilet.
It's like a Pilates class, though. Is it hard?
You don't want to go too much longer than a pee time.
I wouldn't stay here all day.
And the pants go where?
You know, I don't know.
Whatever they do with them.
Come and join me.
Saddle up.
Yeah.
You know,
I got one more idea.
I don't, I don't, you know, how am I gonna do it?
I'd need an inventor.
I know a guy. He's like a patent guy, he's got like 45 patents.
He's an inventor. They're supposed to be eccentric.
Marconi used to go mountain climbing naked.
This is it?
All right, look.
I'm here to ask a favor.
I'm having a surprise party for Jeff for his birthday. which is three days before his birthday. He'll never know.
The guy's got a heart condition.
We go to the same cardiologist,
Dr. Holzer.
Surprises are, are dangerous.
He's gonna love every minute of it. he's gonna love it, and we're having it. Okay?
You know what? I'm gonna go talk to
Dr. Holzer about this. We'll see what he says.
How can I help you?
I was wondering if I could talk to Dr. Holzer.
Okay, do you have an appointment?
No. No, I don't.
Andrew Rusty Holzer?
He put a nickname on the card?
Why's he doing that?
I haven't seen you around before. You new?
Either.
You know, like on a plane. You bring food on a plane?
Hey. Am I crazy?
Yeah. I'm not crazy about this painting, you know.
I'm not coming onto you.
I'm not hitting on you.
Everything's not a hit. People can make conversations without it being a hit.
The whole world is not a hit.
Okay. Have a seat. Thank you.
It's good to see you, Larry.
Everything okay?
What brings you here?
First, I want to ask you about this card.
Andrew Rusty Holzer?
I'm trying it out.
Rusty. It's a nickname.
If you ate a lot of peaches one day, when you were a kid and, and you threw up, maybe you'd be called
Peaches for the rest of your life.
Where, where'd you come up with Rusty?
I feel like a Rusty.
Susie Greene,
Jeff Greene's wife, is throwing a surprise party for him on the 20th, and I'm very concerned
Yeah. I can see that.
Given the condition of his heart,
I just want to see if you're giving that the okay.
That's a trendy spot.
Chris Martin's gonna, he's gonna sing.
Yeah, I don't feel good about this.
The surprise party, wouldn't do it.
That's a good idea.
I mean, that changes things.
I'll talk to Susie.
Be right back. I'm just gonna use the bathroom real quick.
Hi.
I calculated your speed, my speed, the distance, my average urination time, and according to my calculations,
I would have had to wait three to four minutes, whereas you only had to wait 12 to 15 seconds.
I think it was the right move.
It was inconsiderate.
Is that your top speed on this thing?
Did you hear footsteps behind you?
You should have moved over to the right to let me pass.
You should have given me one of these.
You're blocking traffic.
You're in the slow car.
You've gotta let the fast cars through.
No, you've gotta respect the car in the front.
I think you have bad walker etiquette. You're a hallway hog.
Can I make it up to you?
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I'd love that.
I'm Wally, by the way.
Look, I've got nothing against the handicapped.
I've, I've dated two women in, in wheelchairs.
My disabled bona fides
He's trying to finagle an invitation to the party.
You know what?
He's not getting one.
We had two dinners with him and his wife.
Aggressively boring, fuckin' brutal.
Susie, why does it have to be a surprise?
Because I want it to be.
What?
You're trying to kill him.
You want to give him a heart attack, and you want him to die at that party.
That's your plan, isn't it?
You're the most ridiculous
I'm going to the cops.
What do you think of that?
Here's the evidence.
It's an invitation.
You ruin this surprise party,
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Building on basic ideas,
I've come to these three elements.
You have your coffee cup, of course.
That is your heating element, there.
This is all going to be one thing, of course.
Of course, cause you hate cold coffee.
I'm not okay with that.
I love that.
Ah.
Who's my?
Hmm?
Guter Hund.
This is my assistant, Adolf.
I named him after my grandfather, my opa.
He kind of looks like him.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Heil Hitler.
Hey.
Good boy. Yeah.
Good boy.
All right. I found it.
Hey. What the hell's with your dog?
What?
He was growling at me before, like he was going to attack me,
I was scared to death, then I went Heil Hitler, and he suddenly walked over and just lay down.
Did you put your arm out like that
I know what that is.
When I trained him,
I would put a treat out with my arm up, like that.
Heel.
See?
Here's that, uh, drawing I was looking for.
As you can see, these are different elements.
He's a white supremacist.
He named his dog Adolf.
He named his dog after his grandfather.
Hey, if my grandfather was named Pol Pot,
I wouldn't name my dog Pol Pot.
Okay, I think he's more of an eccentric than anything. troop called Stormfront.
He had a great shirt and hat.
I fuckin' love those TV shows where motherfuckin' white guys get in a fuckin' van
No black man would ever chase a fuckin' tornado.
And that's what we're talking about here, the cup.
It's been sitting here ten minutes. Time to test.
Moment of truth.
Hmm.
I swear to you, this is just as hot as it was ten minutes ago.
I mean, this is amazing.
Well, you got Boris to thank for it.
Please, uh, have him contact me.
I got plenty of ideas and shit.
All the taste of pussy, without the commitment.
Well, I'll put you in contact and see if anything flies from it.
Jeff has a heart condition.
I feel like Susie wants to give this guy a heart attack with all these people yelling,
Surprise. She wants to kill him.
You're saying the point of the surprise party is to kill him?
You don't think like a killer.
You don't have a devious mind.
I do. I think like a killer.
I want to kill. she has bad intentions.
I love a good mystery.
I was watching
This motherfucker had me convinced
I did the shit.
Man, you are in a tough spot.
Yeah.
Let's think it through.
She'll kill me.
Then you'll have to live with that.
Eh.
I have an appointment in
Beverly Hills at nine o'clock.
Then I have another appointment in Beverly Hills at eleven.
I don't need the day planner.
I can't go home.
Hello.
Do you have an appointment?
I don't have an appointment.
Do you need to see the doctor?
Can I ask what you're doing?
I'm just between appointments.
This is an establishment.
It's a, it's a business.
And you know what?
My presence here is helping business.
You go in a restaurant, you see nobody in there, you don't think it's any good.
When you see people there, you think it's good.
You've shown up to my place of work, unannounced, and now you're just sitting there staring at me.
Everybody wants me.
There's a certain kind of conceit attached to this, if you don't mind me saying.
Good. Good.
I want you to go to the party.
I got it.
You call Jeff, you ask him out for dinner, at Scopa, on the 20th.
He'll go back, he'll tell Susie.
She'll say no. She'll cancel.
But you never got the text.
No, I'd get the text.
Susie says,
I texted you and cancelled and I'd say,
I never got the text.
Susie scares me.
Yeah, she scares everybody,
She's very scary.
I'm scared of Susie.
Are you serious?
Come on.
Call Jeff.
Well,
I've got work to do.
I've got waiting to do.
You know,
I've never had a handicapped friend before.
I'd like to have friends of all creeds and disabilities.
I mean, who's gonna get mad at a guy like that?
I have a friend who's an amputee.
An amputee friend? Oh,
I'd kill for an amputee friend.
That's not a compliment.
All those horns,
I mean, I studied up for it.
Yeah, I don't need all the details of,
Go ahead. Yeah.
Okay, you just said you would spare me the details, but you're not sparing.
Yeah.
Here we go.
That lady right there?
Yeah, she's right there in that, that leopard coat.
Only she would have a coat like that.
Are we giving her a ride?
No, no, no. Don't honk. Don't honk.
What is she up to?
What is she doing?
Westside Travel and Tour.
Okay, we gotta find a parking space nearby.
How about right in front?
What are you doing? You can't park here. It's handicapped.
Wow.
You can park anywhere with one of these.
Oh.
Love to have one of those.
Okay.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go in that travel agency. pamphlets, brochures, whatever.
Meanwhile, the whole time, you're eavesdropping on her conversation. you report back to me.
Got it?
And what's her name, in case that comes up?
Don't pay any attention to her.
You're eavesdropping.
I wouldn't know her name, anyway.
She would be a stranger to me.
Yes. Right.
Right.
Okay.
Oi.
You gonna need help with that walker?
No. I'm good.
I can't come in with you.
She knows who I am.
And don't come back in the car.
This could be a matter of life or death.
What?
Hurry up.
Don't, don't, don't, don't come back. Don't come back.
I want sun, I want sand.
I want spa.
But nothing too remote, cause I'm a people person.
We can get you to the Pink Sands Beach.
I need it rather quickly.
Bahamas.
Here I come, baby.
I did a pretty good job
What did she talk about?
What did she say?
There you go.
Thanks for lunch.
Great to see you.
I'm out of town.
I get back on the 20th.
Would that be possible?
That is assigned to me.
I'll take very good care of it.
Well, I've never lent it to anyone before, but let me just explain to you what it is. This goes in your car.
I didn't think it was you, Wally.
Okay.
I think we're good.
I think I got it.
Leon.
Leon, where are you?
I got it.
Look what I got.
Hit the fuckin' lottery. The fuckin' handicapped lottery, Larry.
We got the placard.
Let's use it.
You're not gonna do this a second time.
Throw that shit on.
Excuse me.
Got a placard, there.
Okay?
What's next?
This arcade is doing big business.
Thank you.
Yeah.
This thing. Wow.
Ooh.
We got 287 tickets.
Let me get that
Wiffle ball, bat right there.
For my man, right there.
Yeah, he gon' love that shit.
See that?
Ha, ha, ha.
Where are you going?
Yeah, and he's got the cups.
We're in business.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa. Hey, hey.
Heil Hitler.
Yes, that's a good boy.
Who's a good Adolf?
Ooh.
It's the best.
Good choice.
I like this.
This is smart. You know?
And I just made it smarter.
By giving it a power saucer.
Yeah.
Nein.
Guter Hund. Nein.
Adolf.
Was this important?
Yeah.
Had a good trip, a lot of fun.
Great. Great.
The placard.
Yeah. Yeah.
A little problem with the placard.
The dog ate it.
What dog?
Adolf?
Well, he wanted to eat the Star of David, which was right in front of the placard.
The placard was collateral damage.
You want to see it? You want to see what I'm talking about?
I really need that to park.
No, I don't mind at all.
I'll get the placard.
I'll go to your house and give you the placard.
There's no more to be said about it. Here you go.
Why are you going in a circle?
You could have just walked backwards.
Easier to go down stairs this way.
It's easy.
Quick. Ah.
And we're down.
Can't find my cell phone.
She don't know where it is.
All right. You're up.
You know what?
You, you go first.
Five steps.
Just telling you,
I'm out of breath.
How've things been with you and Susie?
She's been great.
Out of nowhere.
But I'm gonna go with it.
She even asked me out to dinner tonight.
She's been a doll.
When have I ever said that about Susie?
I need you to do me a big favor.
Well, she's giving a surprise party for her husband tonight
I need you to wait in front of the restaurant, and when he walks up, tell him that there's a surprise party inside for him.
Why do you want me to ruin a surprise?
Because he has a heart condition.
And this could be a matter of life and death.
Why can't I just call him?
Because he has no cell phone.
He lost it.
It doesn't matter.
You're not going to the party.
You're just waiting outside and telling him about it.
I'm gonna send you a picture and all the information.
Everything you need to know.
I'll text you.
How else could I have called?
What's wrong? Buddy.
Everybody, lots of noise.
Lots of noise.
Hi. Here you go. Noise.
Big, loud booming noise.
The louder, the better.
I don't know what you're thinking,
I got a guy outside. it's a surprise.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
Hey, you can't park here.
It's handicapped.
I usually have one.
It's just,
If you don't have one now, you can't park here.
Come on. Now. Let's go.
Come on.
Hey, Chris.
Want to sing one with me?
I'll probably leave before you get on.
I mean, people pay a lot of money to see us.
Yeah, I know. I don't like to stay around too long for stuff like that.
I'm not gonna be able to look at everybody just looking at you like this and clapping and singing along.
Maybe I'll stay.
Yeah.
Are you leaving?
No parking anytime.
There's nowhere to park.
Let me ask you a question.
You're in your car.
What do you do?
I pull over.
I'll sing in the shower, yeah.
Why would you want to shower with another person?
Yeah, you look terrific.
No. I know it's there.
The West End. Yeah.
Rusty.
How are there no spots?
Before that, though, I was in Oregon, a little residency there.
Do you have a card?
Hey, Larry. We could trade,
He's here.
Everybody quiet. Quiet.
Surprise.
Wow.
What?
Too bad.
Look at his face.
Holzer.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Chris Martin, don't you dare talk to him.
He was not invited.
We left you a message.
You're a liar.
Rusty.
Rusty.
I'm opening up a coffee place.
I've been looking for handles.
I really like those on the coffin.
Would you mind just leaving for a couple of minutes?
What a day on the links, huh?
I've never seen him play like that before. That was amazing.
I don't know what it is.
And I had a great partner.
All right, we'll buy lunch. All right? and you're gonna buy us lunch.
Wherever you wanna go.
Yeah. I've heard good things about it.
Hey, I'm in a great mood.
Wherever you wanna go, we'll go, all right?
All right, you're a little jealous of the Bentley, aren't you.
He never missed a putt the whole day.
Not one putt.
Ah, just a lucky day.
I don't know.
No more than once a week.
I can't really explain it.
But I've never seen anything or felt anything like this.
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
Forget it?
You expect me to forget it?
I, I don't wanna talk about it.
We're not gonna say anything.
It's got this mind of its own. It's just alive.
Yeah.
Holy shit. Really?
Le'Veon Bell, out for the season.
You know how much money the Jets paid for this guy?
You have any idea of how much the Jets paid for him?
He's out for the whole goddamned season. before it even started.
Patriots walk all over everybody. It's over.
Carl, come on. Settle down, man. Honestly.
The three of you, just eat your food and shut up. Leave me alone.
You say this over and over.
What are your expectations?
You're talking about them like they're the Patriots, and then they're suddenly cursed.
They're terrible, year in and year out.
And you beat yourself up, and it makes me sad.
You're not the general manager. or is everyone in that section way better looking than the people in this section. Look. Look around.
You are not imagining things. here. It's like there's and an ugly section.
It just seems, it's, it can't be a coincidence.
I'd like to come here again without you guys.
You know, who knows? Maybe if I came here by myself,
I wouldn't be sitting here.
Why do you think you shouldn't be here?
Cause I know I should be in that section.
You look like Einstein's gardener, for Christ's sake.
You wanna bet?
If I come with you,
I bet they keep you here,
Yeah, I'm the dog in the group.
I couldn't help but notice that the people sitting on that side seem to be way better looking than the people sitting on this side.
And you have an ugly section.
Why would be we do that?
I don't know. Why would you?
You tell me.
I can't tell you, because there's no truth to it.
And I can't do my job, if you're doing your job.
No, I'll be quiet. No problem.
No, it's not a question of that.
You're here.
I need privacy. I need distance.
I need to be alone.
Eh, my boss.
I'll get in a lot of trouble.
You know what I mean?
What's the trouble?
People need me here to, you know, take care of business.
No, no, they don't need you here.
Nobody wants you here.
Everybody's disappointed when they walk in here.
They don't want to see you,
With all due respect, people come in here with bad breath.
I got, I got mouthwash.
People come in here, you know, look, I need a little
They would.
They'd sacrifice it in a second. it leaves the pack. That's what needs to happen here.
I need to be alone.
I'm a dying animal.
I'll give you 20 bucks for you to leave this room right now.
And I'll tell you what,
I'm opening up a coffee shop, okay? Latte Larry's.
I'll give you a free cup of coffee and a scone for a week.
Yeah. I'll, I'll,
I'll do what I can.
Sam Winokur.
We have a coffee maker at the house. Grind up the beans.
Do you know what a latte is?
The latte is just espresso and steamed milk.
Kid know his shit.
Okay. Do you know what milk consideration is?
I'm afraid I don't. No.
You pour too much coffee in a cup, you're not leaving room for the milk.
Cause then it's, you have it spilling over the top.
Have you ever dealt with the public before,
You're hired.
Have you had a chance to have that looked at?
You know, I haven't.
Well, I mean, just looking at it,
I could recommend.
Okay, well, you know what?
That was very impressive.
I think I'll go see your dad.
Yeah. 'Cause he's a doctor.
All right. You, too.
Walking with a hot coffee and shit, shit grab your pants.
I'm Harold. The, the bathroom attendant from the other day.
I got fired for leaving my post. to get my job back,
I would appreciate it. invited me to leave the room.
But you know what, if I may say?
Maybe a blessing in disguise.
The bathroom is a palace of shame.
Just talk to the restaurant manager, please. Okay?
Okay, I'll talk to him.
You got those little mints and shit you guys have on the fuckin' counter?
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Still fuckin' working.
Look at you.
That's from both of us. about that magical vagina.
When you use the word magical, that's takin' that shit to another level.
I wanna see what the fuck that is. could pull a rabbit out of that motherfucker. in that fuckin' vagina and toast that shit.
Hello?
Hey. Did you hear about Carl?
Carl? What?
What?
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, he was, he was playing great.
He said, I can't take any more disappointment.
Holy shit.
I can't take any more disappointment.
That's what he used to say when we would watch the Jet games together.
I can't take any more disappointment.
That's an exact quote. after losses. During games,
I've seen him sob.
And they just kept losing, and it kept eating at him, and eating at him.
The Jets killed Carl.
Okay.
Fuck happened?
Carl. The guy whose wife has the magical vagina.
He killed himself.
Cause of the fucking Jets. condolence text to the widow.
What else?
Try and make the, uh,
I don't know. I can't come up with a third line.
Is it possible I can test drive that motherfucker?
My friend and I have many questions about your magical vagina.
You hear about Carl?
Yeah. Terrible.
It was the Jets.
My God.
He just couldn't take it.
It ate him up inside.
I'm talking about his widow,
Veronica. His family.
You've still got a rash there, Larry.
What, he's not a doctor.
That should be good enough.
Ah, not really. I mean,
I don't want to listen to
That's atopic dermatitis.
Otherwise known as eczema.
It should go away.
Jimmy, what's the rule on this?
He swung, the club head fell off.
But he followed through.
That's a stroke, right?
A stroke is defined by forward movement of the club to the ball.
A shaft in itself is not a club.
Wow. Jimmy.
Is there such a thing as a putter being too straight?
Definitely.
Look at this putter, here.
Definitely not 90 degrees.
Can't be like this.
Has to be like this.
Has to be like this.
Tilt. Just like this.
Well, what do you know?
You know the penalty for a nonconforming club?
He's probably the only one in the club who does that.
You don't say.
Huh.
Well.
Isn't that interesting?
Isn't that interesting?
Marilyn, if you could show them to their table.
And I requested a table by the window.
But I do have a lovely table for you.
Great.
Shall we?
Mr David. Please.
Your table here.
Come along.
Look at this one.
Mr David. Here we are.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Anything else I can get for you?
Why, why did you fire that bathroom attendant?
I asked him to leave.
I requested it.
With all due respect,
Mr David, I can't fire you.
Well, benvenuto a Tiato.
Benvenuto.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Look where I wound up in my life.
In the ugly section.
I'm in the ugly section.
You know, my whole life
I suspected I was ugly.
But I never really knew.
I never had proof.
And now I have proof.
I have proof.
This is it. This is the proof.
What are you talking about?
How did I wind up here?
How come you don't leave your clubs in the bag room?
That's crazy.
Is your putter to specifications?
Are you out of your mind?
I'm asking a question. it can't be over 80 degrees.
You know that.
Look, you're a golf nut.
A roll? I paid you $500.
Let's be clear about that.
You're not measuring my putter.
What?
I'd wait a year.
But magical vagina, six months.
I think the dead husband would, would approve
We were friends. You gotta be pretty curious, though, don't you.
All right, I'm slightly curious.
My interest is piqued.
You were all playing golf together, right?
Yeah. very upset about the Jets.
The Jets ruined our marriage.
I couldn't stand to be around him.
Everything was about the Jets.
We had to paint our room green.
One night, he just woke up and yelled, Watson.
What is that? Is that a Sherlock
No, I think that's a reference to Deshaun Watson, who the Jets passed on drafting in 2017.
I really like the handles on the coffin.
Do you know where you got those, by any chance?
No, Larry, I don't know where I got them.
I'll tell you why I'm asking. Because
I'm opening up a coffee place.
I've been looking for handles.
It seems like I cut you off.
I think I detected a flicker of interest
There were signs that
I picked up on.
She touched my arm, she was very affectionate.
I got a text. and for the kind words.
Can't wait to check out your coffee shop.
You'll text her back in at least a week.
You sent it? What'd you say?
If you need to talk,
I'd be happy to get together for coffee,
Now you're asking her on a date.
You upped it from coffee to a date.
It's a date.
We have a beautiful table for you right by the window.
I, I don't get that. What's the difference between a table for one, and a table for two?
One person.
Is that how it works?
Cause in baseball, a tie goes to the runner.
Here, a tie goes to the ugly.
Mr David, I really do not see a difference you're gonna put this beautiful woman into that section? Is that what you're going to do?
She doesn't belong there.
Yeah, sure, put me there.
No. No, it's not fine.
It's not fine.
Look what's going on over there. Take a look.
The table over here is really lovely.
I think you'll enjoy it.
What a horror show.
This is a fucking horror show.
How the fuck can you do this?
It's not fair.
This is not fair.
How long is she gonna be grieving for?
It's none of their business.
What people didn't know is that our relationship was pretty frayed by that point.
But I know what you mean about, you know.
You know, when I was a kid,
I remember my turtle died.
A little turtle. And my friends called me up and said,
Hey, we're going out.
We're gonna play punch ball.
I said, Eh, you know what? I probably shouldn't. My turtle died.
And then I'm sitting there thinking, geez, my friends are out there playing punch ball.
Yeah. Well, my condolences to your turtle.
What do you keep scratching over there?
You should go see his son.
I never knew that.
Yeah, but he's a senior.
Seating Susie over there?
And the possibility of the two of us getting back together.
No, I meant, what are you doing in this section?
You're on his coattails.
That's why you're here.
The one who just died, who killed himself
First of all, she shouldn't even be out of the fucking house. mourning and grieving. And you.
What makes you think she's not going after?
I bet you she is because you've got a lot of money, man.
That's all she's doing it for.
Good. Who cares? What do I care?
I can't even fathom what depths of depravity would lead you to go after a recent, very recent, widow.
I have been given to understand that she has a magical vagina.
That is the most inappropriate thing I have ever heard.
Can you just give us a second?
I really wish I could, but, Mr David,
I believe your table is waiting.
But she gets to stay here.
You're letting her stay here?
This meeskite?
Look at that face.
Are you serious?
I don't get what's going on here.
I come in with a beautiful woman,
I'm sitting over there.
He comes in with her, and they sit here.
This policy makes no sense.
And I'm not a meeskite, you bald fuck.
Is there a problem?
I think I had a bad ball of burrata.
I could just use a little privacy.
Yeah, privacy.
It's a funny thing.
I know. Unfortunately,
I've got a couple of things I need to do.
You know, freshen up and all that.
Mr David, please.
I can't do my job if you're in here.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we make a little deal?
There is no
That's a yes? Okay.
Okay. And Harold gets his job back. But not this job.
I would have left.
You think I wanna hang around here?
These handles are great.
Sure.
Be careful.
Right on your left there.
Yeah. What's the difference?
Pop the trunk, old timer.
Let's go.
Who are you working with, here?
Whoa, whoa. What's this?
What's this? No.
Is that a Jets mask?
I'm a Jets fan.
Unbelievable. Me, too.
Every year they lose.
They're responsible for murder.
They should put 'em all in prison.
I think my boss is being robbed.
What is this, a putter?
Let me just take a look at this putter.
What happened?
We have to talk.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Did you notice the tremendous tip I left? hoping you'd see it.
I didn't do it for the waiter.
I, I did it for you.
Well, I'm not feeling particularly widowy tonight.
Interesting.
Mm.
Yeah.
Is there anything else on your mind?
Now that your mention it, one small thing.
It was me and Jeff against Carl and Lewis.
Okay. Why are you telling me this?
I just feel I'm owed that money.
No. The, the estate.
I don't know why you're asking this now.
You know, I just feel like
I was cheated out of a win.
The fucking Jets, Larry?
You come into this house, and bring up the Jets?
Do you know how much disappointment
I have had to live with from the Jets?
Do you know what this team has done to me?
I haven't enjoyed a football season since 1969.
No, please, Larry.
Get out of here.
Literally.
Mm. Okay. didn't survive the recovery, Larry.
It is a great honor to be sitting amongst you.
You know, there are a ton of different restaurants for you to patronize
Do me a favor. Get lost.
Very well. Benvenuto a Tiato.
Mille grazie. Mille grazie.
Ah?
A man can relax.
Gentlemen, great to see you.
Well, look who's here.
This is Harold, the bathroom attendant
Not only that,
I'm not getting that look, you know?
Yeah. What, what are you doing in here? Yeah.
I want to thank you again for the referral.
Yeah, she just had a small rash on her neck. right now and that can take a toll on the skin. incredibly healthy skin.
Well, standard checkup is full body. Yeah.
And?
Is anyone here a doctor?
No. But my father is.
Are you?
I never thought I'd hear those words come out of your mouth.
Jon's starring in a movie.
What's the name of the movie?
The Biggest Asshole that Ever Roamed the Earth?
What are you drinking in the daytime for?
We're not at brunch.
No, no, you gotta do it.
I can't do it.
I already got my sweats on.
What is it, an immutable law of physics?
Once you're in sweats, you can't get out?A prominent actor shadows Larry to prepare for an upcoming role. Larry meddles in the sale of Cheryl's sister's house, helps Leon grow a new business and stirs up trouble at a dinner party hosted by Richard's girlfriend.
Hey.
The toes rank second on the body only to the testicles in terms of how repulsive they are. starring Jon Hamm, and Jon Hamm is playing a Larry David‐type writer.
They're going against type, and he wants to, uh, follow you around, spend a day with you.
Yeah, let's do it.
I'm gonna try and make it happen for tomorrow.
We're back.
All right, listen.
We are not getting along at all.
I, I don't even know‐‐
I never thought
I'd hear those words come out of your mouth.
Fantastic.
Make a little dough.
I bought the house.
A gift‐‐ It wasn't a gift for her to sell and make money.
It was a gift for her to live in.
It was a gift.
Would she be allowed to keep the money?
That's the right thing.
Listen, I don't wanna be in the middle of this.
I don't really talk to Becky.
Why?
We've grown apart through the years.
She calls me
Queen Elizabeth.
She calls herself
I feel comfortable.
All right, well, you do it, because Cheryl doesn't feel comfortable.
This Hobe Turner movie is, like, one of the‐‐ is a big thing for me. ‐Yeah. ‐And I'm excited to do it.
I can figure it is to just hang out. ‐You know. I ask‐‐ ‐It's not gonna be easy, Jon.
I'm a very complex man.
But I just wanna say
I'd really appreciate it.
Really. This‐‐ this word appreciate, it's very, very odd.
I robbed your house and burned it down.
I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell the cops. what I'm talking about. the main course.
Yes, we should. things on this.
We should just ask them.
They got‐‐ They know what they're doing.
Ho‐bo‐bo. Ho‐ho‐ho‐ho.
Why are you‐‐
Why are you doing this?
Excuse me. What, uh‐‐
What'd you guys get?
Why do you want to know?
Because we're about to order.
Yeah, but I figured, you know, you're the experts, why not copy you.
Why would you think we're the experts?
Chinese. an expert on food.
Yeah. Yeah, I think it does.
I mean, if there was a table of fat people, and a table of skinny people,
I'd ask the fat people what they were getting.
Cause they're a little more expert at eating than the skinny people.
But I wasn't sure
I heard it right.
You know, you got the schmo.
It's the browsing, right?
You can't stand it.
What do you do if you have to go to the bathroom?
I don't go.
You don't go.
The whole shift, you don't go?
I can't go.
I have to watch.
All right. You know what?
Do you have to go to the bathroom now? ‐Yeah. Yeah, yeah. ‐Thank you.
Thank you so‐‐
Yeah. You're, you're, you're welcome.

We haven't had dinner in a while.
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's have dinner.
Listen, I‐‐
I really want her to come. I‐‐
I really would appreciate it.
See? See what I'm saying with the appreciate?
I see what you're saying. Yes.
What are you talking about?
I don't succumb to appreciate.
I'm not gonna bring her.
For you, okay? shit for it.
You're gonna pay down the line for this. want to meet, asshole.
Thank you.
Well, see ya, man.
I mean, look what you did.
Yeah.
A $10 piss. to take a piss. what a great idea for a business.
You relieve people who have jobs where they can't use a bathroom.
Toll booth collectors, shoe shine stands, parking garage attendants.
They contact you on your phone, it's an app, and then you go down and man the store, when they go to the bathroom.
Do you know how many times
I've peed in a fuckin
Gatorade bottle when I couldn't find a fuckin' bathroom?
Plenty of fuckin' times.
Mm‐hmm.
And know how many times I forgot
I peed in that
Gatorade bottle and drank that shit?
Once.
That's a fuckin good idea.
Thanks for sharing that story.
This could be the pee Amazon.
Gotta Go.
That's catchy as hell.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah. Okay. Come on.
Wow.
What, did you have a party in here?
Nope. Nope. Just me.
Okay.
You know, you're trying to sell a house.
It's gonna be hard to sell a house like, like this.
I gotta tidy up a bit,
I know.
All right.
I'll take care of it, Dad.
Heard about the whole
Yeah.
It made me feel better about myself.
Yeah, well, not anymore.
No. What are you drinking in the daytime for?
Well, we're not at brunch.
What do you want? obviously, I heard you're selling the house.
Yeah.
I'm gonna let you keep the profits to, to the house.
But of course,
I'll get my investment back.
No, no, no. No.
Say I gave you $700,000‐‐
Please don't do this to me, okay?
Please don't do this.
This is my house.
It's all I have left.
Please don't do this to me.
I, I lost my job.
And my boyfriend broke up with me. ‐Geez. Don't cry‐‐ ‐He was from Poland, and it turns out all he wanted was a visa.
Forget, forget it.
You, you, you can keep the house.
You can keep all the money, keep, keep the profits.
Yeah. It's okay.
I think I always had a secret little crush on her.
It was in the daytime.
I love daytime sex.
Ah. It's Jon. going out to dinner.
Where is he?
Did you have sex with my sister Becky?
Who said that?
Becky.
What did she say?
She said,
And, you know, it just, it happened.
I told her, uh, she didn't have to, uh, share the money with me. like prostitution. between two adults. with that, as far as I know.
The door was ajar.
The fuck are you doing in my house?
What is Jon Hamm doing in my house?
I should get this down.
He's starring in a movie, and he's kind of, you know, shadowing me.
He's bas‐‐
That's good.
It's actually not funny,
Act like I'm not here. on the wall. Just, uh‐‐
How comfortable? ‐Yeah.
This is not the time, okay?
It's my house, you're in my house.
Ted and Larry, it's just like you and your sister.
It's the same thing.
It is close. She slept with my friend, Ted Danson. ‐Okay?
That's fine. with her sister? a sister to Larry.
No. It's a relationship with Ted.
I didn't just go have s‐‐
Who's to say that I'm not gonna have a relationship what do you mean?
You know how jealous
Becky is of Cheryl.
You know that Becky thinks of herself as Princess Margaret, and that Cheryl is Queen Elizabeth. you're Prince Philip?
Is that what you're saying?
Prince Philip would put a fucking gun to his head before he had you representing him.
Again, real quick, are we talking about
The Crown now?
You know what, Jon Hamm, it was nice meeting you.
But, really, this is between us.
You know what,
I've heard enough.
Come on, Jonny. Let's go eat. by the way.
Yeah, it's great.
It's great.
You just plopped that into your, into your water?
Yeah, I plopped it in because I like lime with my water.
I know but they, they don't wash these rinds.
You ever see signs in bathrooms,
Wash before leaving?
It doesn't matter if their hands are clean. ‐The rind's dirty.
It's bullshit.
Did you say irked? that word before, but go ahead.
I'm irked because‐‐ with all due respect‐‐
Jon is here, and Michelle is‐‐ you wouldn't let Michelle come to dinner.
I have to watch my Ps and Qs.
I don't wanna watch
Ps and Qs.
Do you wanna watch
Ps and Qs?
What are you, Shari Lewis?
I said you had a bleeding rectum, and that you were worried and scared, and you needed to talk to me alone, and you'd be embarrassed if she heard it.
Are you out of your fucking mind? a better excuse than that?
You should have called me.
I got thousands of 'em.
Nobody respects a person with a bleeding rectum.
You think Lincoln could have prosecuted a war if people knew he had a bleeding rectum?
And by the way, when you come to the dinner party in a few days,
I would not mention it.
Who mentions that at a dinner party?
Do I still have it or‐or am I over it?
There's two Larry Davids.
Holy shit.
Pretty good.
Pretty, pretty good.
Aah.
Well, she doesn't like the way I defended you being with Becky.
Make yourself at home.
I can't go home.
Keep going to Becky's.
Okay.
No.
You're welcome.
We did it.
We did it.
You didn't expect an airport drop‐off, did you? an airport drop‐off anymore. have fun skiing.
I'll text you when I land. unnecessary step. for when I'm gone?
I'm gonna help a friend out with his, uh, with his new business.
He told her you had a bleeding rectum?
Yeah. Now I gotta walk around knowing this woman thinks
I have a bleeding rectum.
I can't live like that.
Cause once that starts to spread, she's gonna tell everybody.
And the worst part is, no one's ever gonna know that the bleeding stopped.
People are thinkin', how does he stop the bleedin'?
Is he wearin' a pad?
Right. Right.
Hey.
There's a parking lot.
Get to work, baby.
Gotta Go.
Can I help you guys?
My name's Larry.
You ever sit in that booth at this time of day and gotta go to the bathroom, what do you do?
I just stay in the booth.
I can't go anywhere, just gotta hold it in.
Until now.
For a dollar a minute, five dollar minimum,
I will sit in that booth while you go and use the bathroom.
I really have to go.
Go ahead, brother.
My man, you gotta go.
Ha‐ha.
Larry. Woo.
Get on out of here. your business.
Stop.
Stop spitting on my shoe.
I'm not, I'm not paying for this.
Give me a fuckin' break.
I'm not giving you a cent.
Fuck it, then.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't work here.
Woo.
Ha‐ha. Woo.
Thank you. your home is lovely.
I should be complimenting you, too, because‐‐
Well, I did pick out,
I would say, a majority of the stuff.
Well, I can tell.
Great taste.
He's sitting down, Richard.
Richard, he's sitting down.
I can't‐‐
I don't want‐‐
You can't sit on the arm.
It's too thin.
Excuse me, everyone, but dinner is ready. into the dining room.
This way.
Richard, darling, this way.
I‐I‐‐ This set only comes with seven chairs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was with her. ‐I never heard of that before. ‐Yeah. You know what?
It was odd.
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Let's enjoy.
You got me sitting in that wooden chair?
She's afraid if you sit on it, you're gonna ruin it.
And even if I did, it's not gonna bleed onto the chair.
How stupid.
You could have said a million different things.
You could have at least said I was better, that I was over it.
The chair's in the house.
You tell the CEO that I want that chair.
You can't get one.
If I don't get a normal chair,
I'd really appreciate it.
All right, you'll get the chair.
We'll wait about 15 minutes for dinner?
Hey, Michelle.
No, he's not‐‐ he's not sitting in the chair. appreciate it.
Really? He said that?
He said he would appreciate it?
Yeah,
I wouldn't lie to you.
Okay. Okay, fine.
Fine, fine.
Very successful.
The whole thing is, it turns out that the thing he's most known for, his big sitcom that he created, he stole it from an Australian sitcom.
He stole the idea. ‐He stole‐‐ ‐What?
What do you mean?
Stole it?
I didn't steal anything.
No, in the movie, not you.
The character's name is Lawrence Dean. as Larry David.
Hey, hey, hey.
Guess what I found?
I found a chair.
Oh.
Yes. Hey.
It was in the garage. you didn't tell me?
I didn't know it was a chair.
It was wrapped up in plastic.
I thought it was, uh, my dead grandmother's ghost. what the fuck it was.
Because they didn't know, and they just found it ‐in the garage. ‐It all worked out.
Look at that. very pretty.
It's very bouncy.
It's, it's kind of bouncy.
Yeah. I love this chair.
Now we can eat.
Thank you.
You guys, do you pick up the rice bowl and eat it like this?
Or do you start on the table, and then pick it up, pick the rice up?
Yeah, eat right out of the bowl.
It's just like eating it over the garbage can.
I want the walnut shrimp?
I'm turning the Lazy Susan the way it should be turned. no, no, no.
A Lazy Susan is like a roundabout, okay?
I don't think you're right. ‐I don't think you know how a roundabout works.
It's first come, first serve.
That's a roundabout. a roundabout works. ‐The cars‐‐ ‐That's now how a lazy Susan works.
Can I ask you both a favor?
Can you please not use that term Lazy Susan?
It's got racist and sexist connotations, and I'd really prefer
Who's that racist towards?
Susans?
Where'd you get that?
I would just like you to not use the term.
You're right.
You know what?
It should be‐‐
We should definitely start using the Ambitious Susan.
Yeah, spin the Industrious Susan.
Ambidextrous Susan, please.
I don't give a shit.
I want you out.
Larry David Junior, you can go, too.
Look at that, beautiful.
Out.
I just got in a huge accident on Mount‐‐
It was a ski school of children.
They're taking me to a hospital, and I don't‐‐
You really are a prince.
Don't worry. I'm calling my travel agent right now.
I have an emergency.
I need to get on the next flight to Denver, please.
I've got one leaving in an hour and 40 minutes.
Perfect. Fantastic.
There's only one seat left.
Shall I book it?
Any other flights going to Denver?
We've got a two, a four, and a six.
The only thing left is coach.
Okay.
Give me the next first‐class flight to Denver.
I'll take it. Book it.
Very well.
Hey.
Hey, Larry.
I got a Gotta Go emergency.
I'm at the shoe shine shop, right?
I need you to cover for me at the newsstand.
The guy relies on me for his six o'clock piss.
Okay. Okay.
I need you to do me a favor.
Actually, do Leon a favor.
I can't do it.
No, no. You gotta do it.
I can't do it, because I have to fly to Denver. my sweats on.
Yeah, well, once I got my sweats on, there's no going back.
I got my sweats on.
What is it, an immutable law of physics?
Once you're in sweats, you can't get out?
Newton's Law of Sweats?
It's Jeff Greene's Law of Day Over.
Listen, I'd really appreciate it. you doin', man?
All right, okay.
Shut the fuck up.
I'll come.
Thank you.
Thank you, by the way.
Hey.
Okay.
The newsstand guy left 15 minutes ago.
Hasn't come back.
I gotta catch a plane to Denver.
Hey, no browsing.
Hey, do you carry
Vegan Living?
Who gives a shit?
Get the hell out of here.
You gotta come and relieve me.
I can't, Larry.
I'm at the shoe shine stand.
This guy's taking a $40 shit.
Aw. All right,
Thanks very much.
Hey.
Hey.
Jonny.
Really appreciate this.
Hey, no prob‐‐
I got seven minutes to catch the plane.
You know, she's my ex‐wife's sister.
Are you together?
No.
No.
Why would you think we were together?
No reason.
I just assumed you were a couple‐‐ we're a couple. We‐‐
I mean, I've never‐‐
I mean, nice to meet you. we just met.
Honest mistake.
But why did you make the mistake? together could be a couple.
Two men, two women.
If I saw a man wearing a yarmulke, standing next to a woman wearing a kerchief and carrying a mahjong set,
Anyway, I'd love to continue our discussion.
It's been very interesting.
I have to catch a flight to Denver. black people in Denver.
Hello, sir. Boarding pass?
You've been randomly selected for a security search, sir.
What? What? Secure‐‐
What are you talking about?
Thank you.
Honestly, if you're looking‐‐
I wouldn't look in the food and wine section.
Los Angeles magazine.
Right down there.
You don't find what you need,
Everything's online.
Excuse me, maam.
No browsing.
No, I'm just looking for an article that
Jay Inslee‐‐
Oh.
What are you doing here?
I'm just watching the newsstand for Larry.
He had to‐‐
Does Larry own a newsstand now?
Spending the last few days with him?
Sit down and talk?
Are you kidding me?
I wanna hear everything.
You might be bored.
Wow.
Do you recognize that signature?
He killed the motherfucker cause the waffles had expired and shit.
Gonna sit in that room and get interrogated‐‐
Hey. Okay? You happy?
Suppose there was an emergency?
Then what?
You take the sweat pants off?
Well, what kind of an emergency?
How did you get hit by a car?
I, I got a piece of pizza, and, and I was crossing the street, and the, the cheese fell off, and I bent down to pick up the cheese, and I got hit by a car.
Who the hell picks up cheese in the middle of the street?
No. You were gonna pick up the cheese, and put it on your pizza and eat it.
Bullshit. I was not.
I was gonna throw it in the garbage.
No, you don't.
And you, fuckstick, don't ever ask me to man any post for you again, cause I'm not doin' it.
Just consider me in sweatpants all the time.
Fuck that job.
I quit that shit already.
All right, I gotta go text Becky now and tell her I missed my flight cause of you two assholes, and tell her I'll be on the first flight out to Denver tomorrow morning.
Actually, second flight.
Why second flight?
First class.
Larry.
Latte Larry's.
There we go.
Okay, don't tell Larry we did this.
You got it.
I've never been in this shop. I just‐‐
It's kind of a wobbly table, you know?
It's like my least favorite thing.
Here we go.
This is sweet.
It's a little more like a muffin than a scone.
It looks good.
I'm saying it's a muffin.
You want me to take it away?
No, I'm gonna keep the muffin.
Thank you.
I first met Mocha Joe‐‐
Mocha Joe.
This is not, this is not a hot cup of coffee.
I beg to differ.
This is not hot.
And I tell you what.
Here's how I'll prove it to you. ‐No, no, no, I don't know‐‐ ‐Would I be able to do this?
Would I be able to do this if this was a hot cup of coffee?
Doesn't even hurt. turned into Larry.
God.
See, now look.
The table. Look at this.
All over the place. you know what, Jon Hamm?
Happy to.
And you're banned, Jon Hamm.
I don't care.
Hey.
I'm here.
Look. Look. Flowers, balloons.
Larry David.
What could be better?
Yeah? Pretty good. you want 'em? Here?
Ugh.
Did you?
Yes, I did.
I couldn't get a seat.
There were no seats.
There were no seats on any of the planes?
I broke my leg.
I'm not worth two hours in a coach seat?
I have a bleeding rectum.
They're okay with you bleeding out of your rectum in first class?
It's a more comfortable place to bleed.
I think it's probably best that you go. but take the ugly balloon, and just go.
Okay.
Hmm.
Ah. Mr Takahashi.
How you hitting 'em, Mr T? doesn't really matter to me, because I don't really see it when I'm inside the car.
It's like being inside your face.
I don't know what my face looks like.
Everything's coming from inside the capsule.
I haven't seen you take one piece of red licorice yet.
Why am I getting into the coffee game?
Because I went to this coffee shop next door, and the guy was such a jerk that I felt like
I got me a little spite store.
Tremendous things in here, by the way.
You're gonna love it.
Look at this.
Coat rack.
You ever see that anywhere?
Tables, they don't wobble.
And self‐heating coffee cups.
Keeps coffee hot for two hours.
Check out that sign.
This is a defecation‐free store.
That's the kind of feature you dream about.
No defecating.
This is not your place.
Stay home.
You're not gonna believe what's going on in here.
Come on.
Larry, that is the most amazing urinary experience
It caught every drop, every single drop.
Thank you.
Hey, going to Mickey's wedding, it's the greatest thing we ever did.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking, you need a title. assistant manager, ‐in charge of beans. ‐How about this one?
Bean cobbler. the pee cube.
See what I'm saying?
All day long, ever since he opened, in and out.
And it's a little light around here today. if you could go over there check out the vibe.
And, yeah.
And my mother.
Do you believe it?
Who's a saint, by the way. ‐Your mom's banned? ‐Yeah, yeah.
Just, you know, get a cup of coffee and come back.
All right, thanks.
Aha, hey.
Look who's here.
Hi. Is this for your benefit?
In case there's any handshaking to be done,
Hey. How about a cup of coffee for Mr Danson?
Make sure to tell Mocha Joe about all the amenities that we have here.
I share this to make you happy.
I'm going out with Cheryl tonight. might want to know. in the loop.
Gotta say, you know, he's doing some interesting things.
He's got the beans.
I don't know how he did it. ‐No, this is‐‐ ‐Yeah, but I gotta taste it again.
Whoa, whoa.
Get your own.
I threw the phone, and I took off.
I had, like, this total beep panic.
Cause you just want to get away from, from the other person.
Yeah, it is.
You know, once I panicked,
I threw my phone out the window. and get the phone. he was beeping as I was, as I was getting out of the car.
I put it in park.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe the car goes through the light and hits a stroller.
I'm just saying‐‐ for manslaughter.
And now you killed a child.
And now, how do you live with that?
Or you can go this way.
This baby was the Hitler of the future.
No. Listen to me.
I love the imagination, but it was a real story with real people.
It didn't need sci‐fi. throwing sci‐fi in there?
You're missing the whole point.
Where's our food?
This is unbelievable.
I'm still hungry.
Even though the baby's dead,
I still wanna eat.
By the way,
It's rare for me to have this opportunity.
Let's go to Pebble Beach.
If he can take a break from his rehearsals. not even be able to do it.
He's doing
Flowers for Algernon.
Yeah, in a small theater.
Why's he doing that? you know why?
I'm gonna tell you why.
Many of my clients do this.
No one wants to see him do that.
I think that's where you're wrong.
I'm going to every performance.
It looks terrific. for the delay.
I'm gonna come right back in a little bit and check on you, okay?
Having or had?
I'm gonna go home.
I'm gonna go to the BMW dealer.
They got the most fantastic licorice
I've ever had in my life.
Happened again.
Mr David.
You're back again.
Hey. How ya doin'?
I'm doing all right.
How are you?
You run into another problem with the car?
This is like the third time this month.
I can tell you that.
The last time you were here, you didn't have the whistle.
You had the check engine light that was blinking. replicate the blink. or fourth time this month, right?
By the way, where do you get that licorice?
I don't know.
Maybe Bavaria. comes from.
And hopefully we will figure out with your car, too.
I'm getting a little tired of coming in here all the time,
I will see what we can do.
All right?
You can't‐‐ $1.30 a cup?
We're not gonna make any money doing that.
You eat them like they're going out of style.
Keep it down.
You're disturbing the customers. with the scones before. with them before.
Come in, come in.
Enjoy the low prices.
Hey, have you tried
Mocha Joe's?
Hey, you remember me?
Ted Danson?
Cheers?
Becker? Cheers?
Any‐‐ You remember me?
Fuckin' tables.
Hey. Come on, buddy.
Relax what? $1.10 a cup,
Mr Danson.
I mean, really.
Who are we kidding here?
You got money invested in this thing.
Joe, I'm worried about you.
I'm serious.
Go to the movies.
I really appreciate it,
Mr Danson.
My mom would like that, too.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
From here?
No, I'm good.
Ha.
Mm.
You have a wonderful trip.
Nothing.
Bags back in the car.
I'm not going. how much longer I can do it,
Ma. I'm slashing prices, but every time
I make them lower, he lowers his.
Listen, you've gotta relax, sweetheart.
You have to.
You know what?
The Green Book.
It's about a guy from Arthur Avenue. anything about it.
It starts at Arthur Avenue.
It ends at Arthur Avenue.
Very good story.
No, I don't want to read.
I want to see the movie with you.
Hold on a second.
Larry David. Okay.
How you doing?
It's Mocha Joe.
This is crazy.
It's like a sweat lodge in here.
Whose idea was this?
Why are we even eating here?
Cause we're trying to avoid that waitress upstairs.
She literally said,
I have diarrhea.
I'm so‐‐
She actually said it?
All right, let's stop talking about her.
This heat's making me nuts.
Aren't you hot?
Take that thing off.
I can't take it off, because I don't,
I don't have a collared shirt, and then Takahashi will, you know, suspend me.
Mocha Joe called me.
Wants to get together.
I think he's crackin.
He said, let's talk, you know, enough is enough.
You shut down?
How's the play rehearsal going?
Are you taking the role very seriously where it means the world to you?
It's the most important thing
I've done in my‐‐ in 50 years in show business.
Why don't we‐‐
I gotta get out of my actor's head.
I live and breathe this guy 24 and 7.
Why, why don't we talk about our golf trip ‐Yes, yes.
You can't go?
You're kidding. the whole thing.
I thought Susie was gonna leave town.
She has decided to stay home.
Wh‐‐ What happened?
Are you serious?
I was dancing. I‐‐
No, no, no.
You gotta contain yourself at the drop‐off.
Of course you're happy.
But you gotta contain it, and you celebrate in the car ‐on the way home. ‐It's Susie.
I couldn't contain it.
What are you gonna do?
Fucked up.
That's a shame, but I understand.
Maybe we'll go, the three of us, huh?
Pebble Beach.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
How's it going?
What are you doing?
I thought you worked upstairs.
I usually do, but with the AC thing,
And here you are.
They're fixing it, but it's a steamy one, right?
And the salad is for you.
Light on the dressing.
Hold on.
Did you ask for croutons?
I, I thought I remember
I asked you.
You did or didn't?
But this is the soup you wanted, right?
Let me know if you need anything, okay? down here, guys.
We're fine.
Top five most revolting thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
Ah, Mr Takahashi.
You. Zip it.
You unzip again,
By the way, how are you hittin' 'em,
Mr T?
Not your concern.
Gentlemen,
I see you're not eating your food.
And her diarrhea.
No, no, no, no.
How do you even know about any diarrhea?
Everyone knows about diarrhea.
It wasn't the diarrhea.
If it's not diarrhea, what is it? it would be called.
Diane.
No one wants this.
Hey.
Hi.
I saw Takahashi yelling at you.
He yells at everybody.
You just, waiting‐‐
You're taking a bus?
Yeah.
Cars are expensive.
All right, come on.
I won't even eat my own sweat.
I don't know, but to be polite, it's like, I don't know.
You'd eat your sweat to be polite?
If I had a girlfriend‐‐
That would be a deal breaker for me.
You can't sweat in food.
It's on the list of rules for a waitress.
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
I'm not sure you're really cut out for waitressing.
Between the sweat and then that whole diarrhea incident‐‐
Okay, I'm just trying to be a waitress, and I wait on you again‐‐
I wait on you guys all the time.
I just figured you would get it.
No, no one, no one gets it.
No one's gonna get that.
No one's down with diarrhea, Diane.
Okay. Well, now I know.
And now I‐‐
I guess maybe I won't do that.
You know what?
I just opened up a coffee shop.
If you're interested.
I would, of‐‐ Yeah.
I would, I would be interested.
Hey, let me ask you this question.
Another mysterious odor?
Looking for a new car.
And my friend Diane is gonna help me pick one out.
She knows all about cars.
She gets Motor Trend magazine.
I know all the brands.
Well, why don't you head on over there where the cars are.
You know what?
I know where the cars are.
Well, shall we go over there?
Yeah, yeah.
We're gonna go over there.
You gotta get a piece of this.
Why don't we shop for a new car now?
You know what?
Yeah. Wonderful. ‐That looks good. ‐That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.
Yeah. Told you.
I think it's from Germany.
I want to get a red one.
Look, you don't fool me,
Mr David.
I am here to buy a new car.
You're buying a car?
Yeah. That one.
You're buying that one.
Yeah, I'm buying that one.
That's why I'm buying it.
You can drive that off the lot right now.
Okay. I will.
Get the paperwork.
I want it fully loaded. a new car, huh? he bought it.
He totally thinks you're buying a new car.
I am buying a new car. ‐Really? ‐Who does he think he is?
Licorice.
All right, you enjoy that.
Don't tell anybody else. to just anybody.
Look what I got. Huh?
Is this even me? This car?
I mean, look at it.
A lot of the douchebags at the club have it.
I got two cars.
That's your biggest problem.
You got two cars. I mean‐‐
I don't even have one car.
I don't even know what bus I'm gonna take to my new job.
Okay.
What?
No.
Yeah. Go ahead.
Take it. Take the car.
Larry, this is n‐‐
This is worth getting fired over.
Are you kidding me?
This is an incredible day.
Thank you.
I will see you at work.
I gave you a car.
What's wrong with me?
Take a right, then another right, then go through the light, and second left.
Go.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Larry?
Are you kidding? you just went right through.
I know exactly what happened.
I saw it.
Look, there's your phone right in the front seat.
You threw it down.
And you were playing
Candy Crush.
I've done it myself.
I just had beep panic the other day.
I see it. I get it.
All right.
I guess that, um,
I mean, we should exchange information.
It's all my information.
Anyway, look at this.
Nothing's wrong with this car.
This is bad.
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna call the, uh, tow company.
I'll, you know,
I'll take you home.
Your cars is the one that's being towed. drive me home?
This is my car.
Come on.
What do you‐‐
You just gave me this car.
You just give away cars and take 'em back?
Oprah doesn't just give out cars and then take them back.
Does that seem fair to you that I gave you a car, you hit my new car, and now I don't have a car? ‐That seems fair? ‐I, I don't know.
Well, I would love to give you a ride home.
I would love to give you a ride home.
Well, how are you gonna do that without a car, Larry?
Please take me home.
Now I gotta get a new car.
I'm gonna get rid of that new one, and I'm gonna buy the same car I had before.
Why don't you just drive your old car?
I gave it away.
When you tell a motherfucker that story, you should say,
Lo and behold.
When a motherfucker says,
Lo and behold, a good observation.
I gotta buy my, my old car new.
Hey, how many pieces of licorice have you had?
Maybe about eight.
I haven't seen you take one piece of red licorice yet.
Black licorice, black jelly beans, fuckin' blackouts, burnt toast.
I don't give a fuck,
Hey, when are you going on that golf trip?
You know, I've been thinking about it.
Jeff's not going.
I'm not gonna go.
That big motherfucker's the glue.
Yeah, he's the glue.
Mm. Jesus.
Boy, my stomach's really bothering me.
I don't trust this guy.
We actually refer to him as the bean‐meister. worry about it. ‐He stays. ‐All right, look.
You know,
I've been thinking about this, what's going on between us,
You okay? You don't look good.
Aah, just excuse me just for a second.
Oh.
You think maybe you should check on him?
He's good.
You okay?
You don't look too good.
Ooh.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Mocha Joe.
You were supposed to watch him.
My belly started to fuckin' bubble.
I couldn't control myself.
Not there.
He's just negotiating.
That's negotiating?
On what planet is that negotiating?
I do it with my mattress guys.
I have 'em out there pounding cotton.
I tell 'em to just get out of there, walk away.
Mocha Joe's not negotiating.
By the way, I, I'm not gonna go on the golf trip. with three guys.
All right, you don't wanna do three, we'll find a fourth.
Okay, you know what?
It, it's not even that.
I, I don't wanna do it without Jeff.
Jeff was the glue, anyway.
Let's face it.
I wasn't that thrilled about going, either,
Maybe it's best for me.
I do have the play coming up and I gotta study my lines.
I'd love to see the process.
Freddy wants to see it.
Aah, that's a little unfair.
I mean, look, ‐the people are around here‐‐
Yoo‐hoo, Charlie.
Charlie, are you in there?
Charlie. Char‐‐ Charlie.
I'm gonna get that operation.
You know why?
Cause I'm smart.
I'm smarter than that mouse, that stupid mouse.
Jeez, a compliment.
You have a natural touch.
But it's very good. ‐It was hilarious. ‐It's not hilarious.
I'm a‐‐ It's dramatic.
It was very moving, then.
The color of a car doesn't really matter to me, because I don't really see it when I'm inside the car.
It's like being inside your face.
I don't know what my face looks like.
Who forgets their face?
I'm in a capsule.
I don't know.
I don't believe you for a fucking second.
Boo‐fucking‐hoo.
Yeah, anyway, you know,
It's only the best licorice in the world.
It comes from Bavaria.
You'll never taste anything like it.
Turn the TV on, put that in front of you, and, and you will enjoy yourself.
Lar. I appreciate it.
Have a nice day in your white car.
By the way,
I don't see the hood.
I don't believe you.
What the fuck am I gonna do with this?
I hate licorice.
It's disgusting.
Cappuccino for Katie.
Cappuccino for Katie.
Cappuccino for Katie.
Okay, coffee and a croissant.
Larry, we need to charge the self‐heating cups.
Where's Diane?
She's supposed to be here.
What is wrong with her?
I totally forgot.
I was gonna call you.
I'm actually not gonna come in anymore. talking about? while I have the chance before I get another job. going to Europe or maybe Thailand.
Europe? You can't go to Europe.
You don't have any money.
Well, actually,
Cause I was a nice guy.
Well, I don't need to drive anymore, cause I'm going on this trip.
Aah.
They're in the back.
Next?
Hello? Next.
Sir?
Weren't you looking where you're going?
You just came out of nowhere.
Is that your phone?
I see what happened.
Yes. I had next panic, okay?
Ow. Jeez. Aah.
I may never walk normal again.
Are you Larry David?
What? Yeah?
Mr David, does look familiar?
What? It's a screener.
These screeners are digitally marked with your name, and there are copies of these appearing all over town.
Impossible.
Impossible.
I, I didn't give them to, to anyone. for you, sir.
Questions? What kind of‐‐
This is ridiculous.
Hey, my goodness.
What are you doing?
You know, you're treating me like a war criminal, for God's sake.
That's him.
He did it.
He took my screeners.
Yeah, this guy.
I had too much licorice from Bavaria, and it gave me diarrhea, and when I was in the bathroom, he took the screeners.
Licorice? Bavaria?
I really hope you get the help you need.
He was in my house.
Thanks, guys.
I really appreciate what you do.
Bye, Larry.
Stop sending people over to shit in my store.
That's insanity.
For a screener?
They can't fine you that much.
Well, they did.
The FBI, they can do whatever they want.
What are you gonna do?
I'm, I'm lucky I'm not in jail. ‐Ten minutes.
Ten minutes.
All right, thanks.
See you out there.
Break a leg.
How does my makeup look?
What's, uh, what's happening with the hair?
It's Charlie's hair.
Charlie looks like he spends a lot of time at off‐track betting.
Well, that's reassuring five minutes before I go on.
How dare you.
You're like a rabbi heckling me at my bar mitzvah.
What is this?
It's licorice.
Susie gave it to me.
Why? What's wrong?
Nah. Nothing.
Well, thanks for coming.
Okay. Yeah. Break a leg.
Hey, don't be depressed.
It's showtime, Charlie.
Algernon beat you.
You lost, Charlie.
Does that mean that
I won't get the operation?
Cause I lost?
I can do better than that.
I want that operation.
We'll have to see what
Charlie.
I'm not afraid of the operation.
Oh.
Because I'm strong.
Yeah.
It's a spite store.
How do you induce labor?
Larry, what are you doing?
Get a second opinion.
Are ya stupid?
Even though she's dead,
I need to shut her up.
